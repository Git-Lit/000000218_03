  TRUE LOVE.


Neither Claire nor M. de Lancour were
killed.


It is as difficult to comprehend how, in
disasters where death seems impending upon all, any
can escape, as it is hard to understand death
being the result of some accident so slight that
it scarcely seems sufficient for the extinction
of a fly. Yet both things happen every day.
Life is outweighed by a feather's weight, and
withstands the blowing up of a city; men
are vanquished by a scratch, by a breath of
wind, by an emotion, and emerge scathless
from some destructive combination tremendous
enough to have crushed them to shapeless  
  
  
  YOL. III.

<!-- Leaf 12, Page: 2 -->
atoms. One is as unaccountable as the other,
and utterly deranges the petty calculations of
our sapience. So do many thousand
circumstances we heed not in this, the perpetual
miracle, called life.


{empty}M. de Lancour and the young Marquise
were saved, neither knew how, for it was next
to impossible to explain why they were not
killed.


The superstitious, self-called devout, ascribed
everything to the virtue of a certain relic worn
by Claire; others said that M. de Lancour's
disinterestedness had saved him, for that, in
so generously devoting himself to preserve
those around him he had, involuntarily,
preserved himself. It is true that, when the
operation of extracting the bodies of the fallen
had begun, M. de Lancour and the young
Marquise were found not insensible, but
stunned, and protected by a cavity formed by
two rafters, which had struck against each
other and made a kind of angle above their
heads. Around them were people severely
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: 3 -->
wounded, beneath them were the dying and
the dead. The accident had been a frightful
one, and cast a gloom over the entire
department. As far as material harm went, Claire
was severely bruised, and had sprained her left
arm. Victor, besides strains and contusions,
had received a cut over the head, of all which
he thought little enough. Physically speaking
this was all, and it was assuredly not much.  
  
  
  But morally?


Morally, a great knowledge had dawned
upon Victor—he was loved. Loved by the
loveliest and purest of her sex. Loved with a
love so strong, that it had welcomed death;
with a love whose strength was matched by its
infinite purity; loved by Claire, whom he must
never see again.


Why ? was it only because Claire loved him
that they could meet no more ? no! it was
because he loved her, and that each knew now
the secret of the other's love; and Victor,
being not only honourable but honest, knew
that this feeling could not be trifled with, and,  
  
  
  B 2
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 4 -->
to be kept holy, must be indulged in from
afar.


There is nothing so false as to represent
young gentlemen falling irremediably in love
with young ladies whom they rescue from some
great danger. The man who saves a woman
he does not already love from some terrible
fate is not brought nearer to loving her by that
act. He has merely, in obedience to some
high sense of duty, or some generous impulse,
grandly asserted himself. If he be in love
with her already it is another matter.


But Victor was not in love with his cousin
Claire, nor had he even specially thought of
saving her upon the occasion in question. He
had, as a man ought to do in such cases,
thought of his duty only, and done what his
duty required; namely, proved himself at the
moment of the largest use to the largest
number. His duty assumed no individual form.
He saw only the threatened human creatures
round him, and did his utmost to save them,
unmindful of any particular one as of himself.
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: 5 -->

It was when reflection came, and the distinct
memory of details, that Victor recognised what
the truth really was. It was not at first. The
first impression was one of horror and of awe;
of solemn recognition of the mighty power
which sets all human combinations at nought,
and of pity for the poor pleasure-seekers who
had seen their hour of harmless enjoyment
turned into one of wailing. When general
suffering and sorrow are around him, no man,
worthy of the name, reverts to himself, but
merges himself into his kind, and feels
collectively. Take a man to the verge of death, let
him feel the chill breath of the destroyer on
his cheek, and he will come back cured of
many things which he took into serious account
before. It is only the firmly-rooted growths,
the rock-plants of his soul, that withstand
these shocks: the seedlings are scattered to
the winds.


At first, then, M. de Lancour did not revert
to himself or to his own personal sensations :
he did all the good he could, and when that
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 6 -->
was done he returned to Tours with the other
officers of his regiment, one of whom was far
more seriously hurt than himself.


He had acted : when action was over he
began to think, and from memory and thought
combined sprang the dream of what he knew.
And then with consciousness came joy. Yes!
Victor's first feeling upon recognising the truth,
was a deep heart-filling joy—the joy that thrills
through every noble nature when it receives
the one great gift, the gift of a human soul.


And that gift he could not accept. He had
accepted the donation of a lesser love, but this
one he must renounce. Renouncement had
become the law of his being now. He must
not dare to love Claire; not only because she
was not free in honour to love him, but because
he was not free in honour to love her. He had
bound himself to another, whose so-called
sacrifice he had not rejected. And then he
plunged into the past, dived down to its utmost
depths, and saw that which lay beneath the
surface and shuddered at the levity with which
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 7 -->
honour, purity, integrity, all that should be held
most precious, had been abandoned. Seen by
the light of Claire's thoroughness and simplicity
of character, what was Berthe de Mottefort?
Victor shrank from the question, for he could
not but judge Berthe, and he had no right to
judge her. She said she had sacrificed herself
for him! Was this true ? No! she had
merely sacrificed duty to inclination—to an
inclination which, because she was weak, she
had called irresistible. Claire who, while they
both lived, would never permit him so much as
an impure thought about her,—Claire, to share
death with him, came serenely dauntless to his
side, whilst she, who had trampled on her own
fair fame for love of him, fled shrieking from
the danger to which he remained exposed.


This merely brought confirmation to his mind
of that which he had long laboured not to
admit; namely of Berthe's moral inferiority.
Berthe Avas unworthy, but that regarded him
not. She was unworthy of the surrender of a
man's whole life, but in her un worthiness lay
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 8 -->
the lesson. Where would have been the penalty
had she been worthy ? had she, whose fault he
had shared, brought him peace and satisfaction,
what would have been the payment exacted
from him for infringing laAvs human and divine?
It was as compared to Claire that Berthe sank
to so low a level, but had he not lost his
privilege of communion Avith the lofty and the
pure ? What Avas his right to the commerce of
angels, he who had worshipped at the shrines
of the idols of clay ?


And this was the real hardship: this the true
punishment for the evil done. It Avas not alone
that Claire was denied to his thoughts, it Avas
that his thoughts were condemned to centre in
another. He was not released from the old
bondage. It endured and would endure; and,
however he might avow his error to himself,
the consequences of the error must subsist,
and he must honestly pay Avith all his
protecting care and devotion the fatal present made
him by a woman who had lightly throAvn
herself away!
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 9 -->

Victor did not for a moment seek to elude his
self-incurred responsibility; he was, as I have
said, inflexibly honest, and whatever might be
the cost would in no circumstance of life leave
a pledge unredeemed. But he suffered severely,
and saAv for the first time in their real forms so
many things which, in the life of the world,
come to us in disguise, and are accepted for
other than they are.


There was nothing serious, as we stated
before, in the hurts received by M. de Lancour at
the fall of the grand stand at Combeville, but
there was enough to produce temporary illness.
The depression of a rib, unnoticed for a day
or two, induced an attack of intercostal
neuralgia, as the physician termed it, and brought on
neuralgic fever, so severe as to confine Victor
to his bed for several days.


For the pain he cared little, but in the
seclusion he rejoiced; and for the first time in
his life made the most of an illness in order to
secure solitude.  
  
  
  Madame de Mottefort had escaped from the
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 10 -->
Combeville catastrophe with nothing save a
few scratches and sundry damages to her dress,
but she lived in a very retired manner at Tours,
and no one as yet knew her by sight. It Avas
vaguely known that M. de Lancour had some
illicit connection Avith another man's Avife, but
no particulars had transpired, and Berthe
Avould not have committed the indecorum of
going in person even to Victor's door to
inquire after him.


Solitude he did then in reality secure to
himself for a whole fortnight, and during that
time he thought out many a moral problem,
and laid down for himself some of the few
principles he Avas yet in time to hold by.


At last, one morning after reading the
Moniteur, he suddenly rang for his servant,
ordered him to pack up his valise, wrote a
short note to his colonel, another to Madame
de Mottefort, and took the afternoon train up
to Paris, looking as though some extraordinary
piece of luck had lightened him of half his
cares at once.
<!-- Leaf 21 -->
  
  CHAPTER II.  
  
  
  THE FAEEAVELL.  
  
  
  And Iioav had it been with Claire ?


Well, and calmly to all appearance. Her
chief occupation had been that of striving to
help and comfort the families of those who had
most suffered in the accident at Combeville;
and in this she was mainly aided by Madame
Beaudouin. These two, setting at nought all
distinctions of opinion and all petty divisions
of class or coterie, went, as Christian women
should, from house to house, their hearts full
of tender zeal and genuine sympathy, to see
Avhat succour or consolation could be afforded
to the afflicted. It was not quite such plain
sailing as you might fancy, for the persons
concerned Avere far more susceptible, and far
less easy of approach than the so-called
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 12 -->
poor. These were nearly all people belonging
to the well-to-do middle-classes, rich
tradesfolk, employe's, and small government
functionaries, people who resent far more
indignantly the notion of a condescension than
that of an injury. Yet Claire and Madame
Beaudouin seemed to possess the secret of
Avinning their Avay, for on all sides they were
sincerely welcomed, and grateful hearts
responded to the truth of the kindness offered
to them.


Madame de Clavreuil could not understand
Iioav they managed it, and she imparted to the
ladies of her OAvn set that it seemed quite a
gift in the young Marquise to be able to go
about among people who Avere not of her own
condition and leave upon them a pleasant
impression.


\"I never know what to say to them," said
the worthy Countess.


\"Besides Avhich," responded the lady to whom
she addressed the above remark,—" they
contrive to be affronted by Avhatever you do say."
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 13 -->

HoAvever, thus it was not with Claire, and
she and Aunt Clementine gained real friends
and Avell-wishers wherever they went.


But the effect produced by the
Combeville catastrophe wore off, as such things
eventually do, even in small provincial centres,
and there AAras no more cause for Claire's
activity.


How would it be with her when she had
nothing more to do ? What would her own
heart say to her when she came to be thrown
back upon its communings ?


That moment came, and Claire remained
unaltered. Serenely cheerful, and free, as it
seemed, from all perturbation of spirit, she
was more affectionate with her mother than
she had ever been since her marriage; to her
husband she showed marked kindness; of her
child she grew passionately fond, and perhaps
in her piety there was more fervour than
heretofore; but above all else a deep calm seemed
to spread itself over Claire.  
  
  
  Three weeks had elapsed, and M. de Lancour
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 14 -->
had never returned to Clavreuil. NeAvs of him
were received daily at the chateau, for Count
Rene, besides frequently going over to Tours
to speak to the physician Avho was attending
his nephew, had established regular
communications with Victor's brosseur, a very devoted
servant who had accompanied his master in
all his campaigns. M. de Clavreuil was dimly
convinced, though he could not exactly make
out why, that Claire owed her life to Victor;
that the latter was much more hurt than he
admitted, and the gratitude he conceived thereat
Avas so lively that he abjured at once all the
repugnance treasured up for long years by all
around him for the name of Lancour, and was
incessantly talking of Victor, and of the
admiration Avith Avhich his African nephew had
suddenly inspired him.


At last, all doubts as to M. de Lancour's
complete recovery Avere brought to an end, for
his sudden departure for Paris Avas announced
one day at dinner by the Count, who merely
added that he Avished he could have found
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 15 -->
time to come and shake hands Avith them
before starting.


\"He's had enough of being moped up in a
sick room, and in country quarters; I dare
say he counted the minutes till he could shake
himself out a little on the pavement of Paris,"
said a country neighbour, whose idea of
Paradise was the capital, where he never went, and
of the other extreme, the province, where he
was condemned to live.


Between Aunt Clementine and her niece
Victor's name had never once been mentioned
since the day when Claire appealed to Madame
Beaudouin to try and protect her against the
necessity of a marriage Avith Olivier.


And so the days went by, and the following
week was to see the young Marquise
re-established till the close of the year, in the home
which was hers now, but which, do Avhat she
would, she could not look upon familiarly.


The Vivienne marriage had taken place, and
the young couple, absent on their honeymoon
trip, were to return at the end of the month,
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 16 -->
and Mont-Vivienne and Beauvoisin were (it
had been agreed) to be the head-quarters of
all the gay doings of the department. Claire
Avould have in good earnest now to discharge
her duties as mistress of a large household,
and donor of magnificent entertainments, for
therein lay not the ambition of her
mother-inlaw.


The Dowager liked to govern people, but
did not care to amuse them; she
domineered in a severely practical, business-like
sort of manner, loved her own way, and tried
to force everybody about her to shape their
lives accordingly that Avay; but she Avas
neither cultivated nor elegant-minded enough
to enter into what, in France, is the Avork of
receiving upon a grand scale. All this
Avould fall to the share of the young Marquise,
and, from All Saints to the middle of January, j
she must be for ever in the midst of a croAvd—
an intimate crowd, more irksome far than the
anonymous one that constitutes the great
Avorld of Paris, and her constant companions
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 17 -->
would be that bridegroom and bride whose
names were for ever identified with M. de
Lancour's declaration of his dislike of marriages
between cousins!


Well, the memory of this declaration that
had so hurt her at the time had lost all
bitterness now for Claire; and in the harmonies
which resounded through her soul, there was
apparently no jarring note.


Claire would often now pass long hours
alone in that room of hers in her own old
home, and had you looked at her then, you
would have seen that, absorbed in some fair,
sweet vision, she was miles and miles away
from the rivings and rubbings, and
disappointments and crosses of this everyday life
of ours.


She was seated in one of these seemingly
peaceful day dreams of hers, one afternoon
towards the end of October. It had rained
heavily in the morning, and it was only as
the sun journeyed towards the west that he
shone forth in golden rays, determined as it  
  
  
  c  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 18 -->
were, before he set, to console vexed Nature
kindly.


Claire sat at her Avindow, looking out at
so many familiar objects which, strange to say,
seemed immeasurably distant noAV, for they
came not Avithin her dream, which tended
heavenwards; she watched the wet boughs
that, at every breath of Avind, shook out bright
showers, turned by the sunlight into drops of
gold, and listened mechanically to the
tAvitterings of birds aa71io, from their leafy coverts,
chirped feebly to each other, that they
had outlived the storm. All earth seemed
resting after agitation : so, too, Avas Claire,
and like all idealistic natures, she had, in
this neAv phase of her heart's life, a deep,
though unconscious delight in finding in
the outAvard aspects of Nature, a kind of
echo to the vibrations of her own innermost
being.


A knock came at her door, and, a moment
after, Madame Beaudouin entered.  
  
  
  There Avas a certain air of hesitation about
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 19 -->
her, and she did not speak at once; but looked
earnestly at her niece.


The young Marquise rose, and laying her
hand upon the hand of Madame Beaudouin,
replied to her look with one so eloquent, that
plainly betAveen these two Avomen no words
were requisite.


"Your cousin, Victor," began Aunt
Clementine, still with a slight trace of
embarrassment 


\"I kneAV he would come," interrupted Claire,
very quietly, and without the smallest sign of
flutter or of joy. " I have been Avaiting for him,
for many days past. Is he gone ? or is he still
there ?"


\"He is there, darling," rejoined Madame
Beaudouin; but still as though there were
something she did not like to tell.


\"Does he wish to see me ? " asked Claire, in
the same calm tone.


"Yes, dearest," said her aunt; "he has
come on purpose to see you."  
  
  
  " Where is he ? "  
  
  
  c 2
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 20 -->

\"In what used to be your atelier, beyond
the great dining-room, where no one ever goes,
for " and Madame Beaudouin hesitated
more and more; "for he desires to speak with
you alone." She uttered the concluding words
in a Ioav tone.


"It is also my wish," said Claire, as she
passed onwards towards the door. Before she
had quite reached it,


"My child! my darling!" murmured
Madame Beaudouin, suddenly straining her niece
in a close embrace, and gazing at her with
eyes overfloAving Avith tears.


\"All is as it should be, aunt, dear,"
responded Claire, gently disengaging herself from
Madame Beaudouin's arms, and printing upon
her forehead a tender, loving kiss. "All have
their trials and must bear them, but I am very
happy."


The voice that spoke these words was steady
Avith the weight of the truth it bore, and the
Avhole aspect of the speaker was one of calm,
sweet, serenity; but oh ! so grave.
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 21 -->

The young Marquise went to seek her
cousin Victor, and found him in the little
scantily furnished turret room, which had
been her study when she was a girl.
Unfinished pictures of hers hung yet upon the
walls, and a ray of sun, struggling through the
vine leaves that grew around the rarely-opened
window, fell upon her easel, in the very place
Avhere she had left it when she bade adieu to
her father's house.  
  
  
  The cousins were alone.


Victor was standing at the window, looking
out over the little wooden bridge over the
moat, which no one ever crossed, because it
was reported unsafe. He turned round when
the door opened, and advanced to meet Claire.


She could not but see how very much he was
altered, and what traces were left upon his
countenance by mental strife and pain.


For a few seconds both were silent, and
merely looked into each other's faces. Was
there indeed any need of words ? had not both
one purpose, both one faith ?
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 22 -->

Yes! but in the oneness of that love, how
you might have marked the difference of
loving between the Avoman and the man! he
was tortured, she was calm; he had achieved
victory, but had fought hardly for it, whilst to
her the consciousness of being loved was so
sufficing, that as yet she knew of no victory to
fight for, she had gained everything, and felt
most for his suffering.


\"I have come to say good-bye," said Victor,
at last.


"I kneAV you Avould come; I have been
expecting you," ansAvered softly Claire.


"I have come to say good-bye," repeated
Victor.


"You do rightly," replied the young Marquise,
in a more subdued tone; and, after an
imperceptible pause, " you do rightly, as you always
do," she added sloAvly, and looking at him Avith
tender approbation, "where is it you are going?"  
  
  
  " To Africa," he rejoined.


Claire's heart gave one bound, and she
turned pale.
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 23 -->

\"It is not a change of garrison," remarked
quickly M. de Lancour, who instantly divined
the cause of her agitation, " it is an expedition
against the Kabyles that I have asked leave
to join. I go quite alone, not even one of my
comrades accompanies me."


A flush replaced the pallor on Claire's
features.  
  
  
  " Do you leave soon ? " she inquired.  
  
  
  " To-night," he replied,  
  
  
  " To-night ? " she repeated.


\"I leave Tours to-night and Paris to-morrow
night."  
  
  
  " Who commands the expedition ?  
  
  
  " MacMahon."


And then again there was silence, and they
looked into each other's faces; looked tenderly,
firmly, looked all they felt. But Avhat more
was there to say? This was no case for loud
assurances; no case for promising to love;
this was the love itself paid down. They were
dealing with stern facts; and the very quality
of their love made them deal rigidly with them.
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 24 -->
  
  What was there more to say ?


She did not bid him be careful of his life,
nor did he beseech her to preserve his memory
—for she knew he was brave, and he knew she
was true; and both were Christians mindful of
their duty to God.


Silence endured between them for many
minutes still, if that indeed was silence
in which soul so ardently communed with
soul.


And then six o'clock striking from the
clock of the chateau reminded M. de Lancour
that his time Avas limited.


\"Good-bye then, now," he said, in a very low
voice, and preparing to depart.  
  
  
  " Good-bye," she echoed.


Not one expression of endearment had
passed their lips, they had not called each
other by their names, nor had they even shaken
hands, when, in the extreme of this their
solemn severance, Claire held out hers to M. de
Lancour.  
  
  
  He took and held it one instant firmly in his
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 25 -->
grasp, then slowly bending down and
imprinting upon it reverently one kiss,—


\"God in heaven bless you, my ovra dear
cousin Claire!" was all he uttered, and then
he left her.


Claire answered not in words, but with a
look, and the look rested still on the place
where Victor had stood, long after that place
was empty.  
  
  
  And thus the cousins parted.
<!-- Leaf 36 -->
  
  CHAPTER III.  
  
  
  THE SINNER SEEKS THE SAINT.


The Aveek following M. de Lancour's
departure for Algeria, Claire returned to
Beauvoisin with Olivier, Madame Beaudouin repaired
for the autumn months to a chateau her
husband had left her between Bordeaux and
Bayonne, and M. and Madame de Clavreuil
buried themselves up to the ears in the hopeless
monotony of country life in France (when it is
monotonous), he shooting—she embroidering,
till custom would call them again up to Paris.


They had deeply regretted not having seen
Victor before he started, but they had only
themselves to blame; he had come, they Avere
out, Claire and Madame Beaudouin had both
seen him, and received his parting words, and
therewith all was ended. To be sure, it was a
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 27 -->
most extraordinary freak of his to have gone
off so suddenly, but he was so ambitious, and
so restless, and so madly attached to his
profession, that, after all, no freak of this kind
was, perhaps, to be wondered at on his part.


The three months' festivities at Beauvoisin
were surmounted by the young Marquise with
singular ease, and the whole county agreed
that so perfect a mistress of a house had never
been seen. Forgetting nothing, overlooking
no one, equally gracious to all, calmly cheerful
and never tired, Claire was, at the close of the
season, held up by the elders as a pattern to
her own generation. The Due de Vivienne
said she reminded him of his maternal
grandmother, the Princesse de Nogent-Valnoix,
Avhom he remembered when he was a child;
and M. de Moranges declared that she was the
last grande dame France Avould ever see.


"She is so quietly self-possessed," was
invariably the phrase with which he wound up
his praises of his niece.  
  
  
  " Because she has no nerves," was the
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 28 -->
objection sometimes raised by those of her own
sex who, though they all admired and even
liked her, avoAved that they did not altogether
understand her. They mostly accused her
of indifference, and they Avere, maybe, not
thoroughly in the wrong.


Claire was in that stage of her inner life
Avhere one idea absorbs everything, and, free
from all reproach, she gave up her heart and soul
to that idea to feed upon. Her entire external
self she devoted to others, but without a shade
of preference, being the same to all.


You must take with you that Claire's dream
from childhood upwards had been her cousin
Victor; and that, right or Avrong, her real
misery had sprung from the thought that she
could never be anything to him. And noAV
she was everything! Pure as she was, how
could she be other than enraptured? This
was the ideal, romantic love she had pictured
to herself throughout her youth—the love of
the young Conde" for Marthe du Vigean, the
love that such noble spirits as Marie de
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 29 -->
Hautefort would sanction and might feel—the love
heroical, ecstatic, if you will; exaggerated and
unnatural, many readers will perhaps exclaim;
but nevertheless, the love that inspired the entire
age of chivalry all over the world, and that, let
it not be forgotten, was for centuries the ideal
of French women of a certain condition.


Separation was not for Claire what it was
for M. de Lancour, for she had obtained now
all she desired; she had no desire beyond. In
the glorious assurance of Victor's love lay her
whole conquest, and she perceived nothing of
what failed her.


There was, in fact, no separation for Claire.
Victor was for ever by her side, as she felt
convinced she was by his. Nothing could ever
divide them, though on earth they might meet
no more.


Here was the secret of Claire's tranquillity
and self-possession. She was, in fact, possessed
by one thought, wrapt in her dream, and saw
everything around her from a distance.  
  
  
  Olivier had apparently quite outlived the
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 30 -->
unpleasantness of the election, and was on the
best terms with all his neighbours. He set up
a pack of hounds in imitation of Gaston de
Vivienne, and (the forest lands of the
department lying wholly in these districts) these two
packs did considerable mischief among the
boars and stags. Olivier's enjoyment in all
this was only uoav and then interrupted by a
journey of two or three days to Paris, no one
kneAV Avhy, but he mentioned urgent business,
and no one noticed that these absences invariably
coincided Avith the arrival at Brunoy of the
Marquis de Moranges.


At Christmas there was still open house at
Beauvoisin, and there were private theatricals
at Mont-Vivienne.


{empty}M. de Moranges had returned to Paris. One
bright frosty day, as he was getting out of his
brougham, in the Rue de la Paix, the Marquis
met Madame Beaudouin.


"You here, at this season!" The same
words Avere uttered by both.  
  
  
  " My being here has nothing surprising,"
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 31 -->
said Madame Beaudouin, as she smilingly held
out her hand; "lama hermit. There are no
dead seasons for me; for the world and I have
long ceased to take each other into account.
But you, one of the Kings of Fashion, in Paris
in December, that is an astonishing
circumstance! "


"Where is one to go to?" rejoined M. de
Moranges. " I do not enjoy the country in
Avinter; yet I confess to being lonely in town :
however, for that matter, one is lonely
everyAvhere."


Madame Beaudouin was struck by the
despondent tone in Avhich M. de Moranges spoke;
and, as she looked steadfastly at him, she saAv
hoAV great was the change in his appearance.


You could not say of him that he looked his
age, for he had always done that—as a healthy,
well-constituted man should do; but, whereas
he had hitherto carried his years lightly, bravely,
his years now seemed to be pressing doAvn upon
him heavily.  
  
  
  Madame Beaudouin had heard it remarked
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 32 -->
at Clavreuil that the magnificent Marquis Avas
much altered, but the truth of the remark had
not struck her then; it did strike her noAV.
{empty}M. de Moranges' features were care-worn, and
bore traces of pain and anxiety.


Aunt Clementine's sympathy for all living
creatures AA-as such, and her conception of
human weakness so unbounded, that she never
stopped to inquire what he was who suffered,
but how his suffering might be assuaged.


\"If such a dull fireside as mine could seem
pleasant to you," she said, " there is a seat for
you there at all times. I never go out of an
evening."


The Marquis brightened up at these words,
and the sAveet, frank simplicity with Avhich they
Avere uttered, seemed to warm him.


"Are you in earnest?" he asked. "May I
really come sometimes? "


\"I am always in earnest," was her reply.
' You may come at all times; you will always
be welcome."  
  
  
  And M. de Moranges did go frequently to
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 33 -->
sit by Madame Beaudouin's fireside, and her
sympathy being genuine, he invariably went
comforted aAvay.


One evening, he had remained later and
talked less than usual, and the care that sat
upon him appeared more than habitually
oppressive.


After a long pause, during which M. de
Moranges had constructed many a dainty edifice
between the logs of wood, and then gazed at
them intently,—


\"If I were sure you would not be
angry with me," he began, "and not regard
as an impertinence what I might have to say,
I would "  
  
  
  Madame Beaudouin interrupted him,—


\"I am never angry," she observed; " and
you cannot say anything I ought to object to
hear."


\"Well then," he retorted, " forgive the
bluntness of my words: you are the only woman I
could have married. You are not angry Avith
me?"  
  
  
  D  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 34 -->

She looked at him with her usual air of
compassionate kindness,—


\"Why should I be so ? " she answered; " it
is a great compliment you pay me."


"It is so," said M. de Moranges, gravely;
\"and so I meant it: but then, you knoAV, I am
such a sinner that any save the superior woman
you are would "


"Hush!" rejoined she; "there are no
sinners, and no superiors. You exaggerate
both the good and the evil. We are all, in the
end, very much alike. Some are weaker than
others, and, therefore, more to be pitied; that
is all. Very much more to be pitied," she
added, slowly and impressively.


"And you?" inquired the Marquis,
involuntarily.


"I?" echoed Aunt Clementine, with
irrepressible emotion, " I have to thank God for
His mercies every hour of the day." Her
voice trembled, and there were tears in her
eyes.  
  
  
  Had M. de Moranges' club comrades and
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 35 -->
ordinary associates been questioned, they Avould
have declared inexplicable the attraction
exercised over him by Madame Beaudouin.


The miracle was easy to explain, and lay
entirely in the fact of the infinite womanliness
of Aunt Clementine. She was such a thorough
woman; so generous and tender, so
self-forgetting and true!


"Why did you never marry?" she asked,
almost timidly.


"Because—" and then he hesitated; "well
it is a difficult thing to say—because I never
found a woman I could rely upon."


\"That is a grave accusation; but did you
ever love any woman with all your heart ? "  
  
  
  " No," replied Moranges, unhesitatingly.  
  
  
  Madame Beaudouin looked pained.


\"I can never understand men," she said,
after a pause of a moment; "you find them
recoil before the slightest sacrifice made to an
honest and pure affection, and then all at once
casting away their lives, names, everything for
a folly," (M. de Moranges winced); " they will  
  
  
  D 2
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 36 -->
pass half their lives in flying from what they
call love, and yet commit acts of absolute
madness for some one for Avhom they do not
care. What do they gain by it ? " she uttered
these last words musingly, and almost as
though speaking to herself.


"Nothing," responded the Marquis, in a
dejected tone; " but they find that out too late.
We have become complicated machines, we
men, and Avhat seemed plain and simple to
our grandfathers, puzzles us. Listen; I, for
instance, pass for a sinner, as I said before;
well, I tell you now, that I don't believe the
man lives who, if he could be perfectly sure of
a deep, true, entire, pure, out-and-out devotion
in a woman (but mark you, both out-and-out
and pure), would not sacrifice everything he
possesses to obtain it."


Madame Beaudouin looked him steadily,
inquiringly, and full in the face.  
  
  
  He ansAvered her gaze.


'Yes," he repeated, "everything he
possesses. But Ave don't believe; we learn too
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 37 -->
early to know the women who have brought
up our possible Avivres, and we shrink from
being made dupes. Love marriages don't
succeed in France; but Ave gain nothing in
the end."


And so they talked on till late, with long
intervals of silence, and Madame Beaudouin
felt there Avas an anxiety or a grief the
Marquis did not venture to confide to her. Once
or twice he seemed on the point of
communicating to her some hidden care, but he ahvays
checked himself.  
  
  
  When he was preparing to take his leave,—


"I shall never forget," he said, "the
kindness you have shown me. I may have to
absent myself shortly from Paris—perhaps
even from France; but Avherever I go, I
shall carry your memory with me; I entreat
of you to believe Avhat I say; among all
my faults I have never been accused of
insincerity. It is not in my Avay to be a
phrasemaker."  
  
  
  " I wish I could have been of real use or
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 38 -->
comfort to you," replied Madame Beaudouin,
as she held out her hand to him.


\"You have been so, and you can be so still
more, if you will promise me, whatever you
hear of me, to reserve your judgment, in spite
of my reputation, and not think worse of me
than of any other erring mortal."


There was an air of almost mournful
earnestness in the Marquis that strangely
impressed Aunt Clementine. She did not
Avithdraw her hand from his as she asked,—


\"Is there no Avay in which I can be of use
to you?"  
  
  
  For one moment he hesitated, and then,—


"I fear none!" he ansAvered; "in your
career as a hospital visitor and nurse, you
have seen, doubtless, many a sickening sight,
tended many a ghastly wound; but you have
mostly seen your patients die of their ills,
which is, in fact, nothing; there is Avorse than
that; there is But what am I talking of?
forgive me, and again I say, promise me one
thing, when you hear me abused on all hands,
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 39 -->
denounced by my nearest relations, and held
up to shame, promise me to remain silent."


\"I Avill do more, I will pray for you," said,
simply and almost tenderly, Aunt Clementine.


\"I wish I thought that Avas of any good ! "
replied the Marquis, with some of his old
gaiety.  
  
  
  " May I try to defend you ? " she said.


"Not for worlds! Avhat I am about to do
cannot be defended."


"Why do you do it?" added not severely,
but seriously, Madame Beaudouin.


\"That you could only understand if once
you came to see Avhat a terrible mistake life
has seemed to be to some men."


When M. de Moranges had left her, Aunt
Clementine felt more than ever convinced of
her theory that all men suffer, and that
therefore all men are to be pitied.
<!-- Leaf 50 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.  
  
  
  A SINNER BUT NO SAINT.


When his uncle had spoken to him at
Clavreuil of the doubts that were harassing
him, Olivier's first feeling Avas one of
apprehension for himself and annoyance with
Claudine. For a mere nothing he Avould have
actually taken his uncle's part, and, from every
possible point of view, he was disposed to feel
irritated against Claudine. Why had she
crossed his path? why had she taken a fancy
to him ? why had she not left him in peace ?
He was utterly oblivious of the readiness with
which he himself had become her accomplice,
and only chafed at the notion of the bother
which her ill-timed, ill-placed passion for him
might entail upon him.  
  
  
  Here lies the difference be.Aveen a pure and
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 41 -->
an impure attachment. The former rises
superior to all mere material separation; the
latter knows of actual presence only, and you
annul it if you separate the so-called loving
couple. Away from the Sphinx, Olivier, as has
been already stated, Avas liberated from any
attraction she might exercise over him, and
simply vexed at having the lazy easy-goingness
of his existence disturbed. Besides, thou_.li
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin lacked the keen aptitude for
planning and combining that is one of the
springs of avarice, he thought upon the
subject of his uncle's inheritance pretty much
as did the Dowager. He could not imagine
his son (poor innocent little Pierre Avas the
invariable stalking-horse of them all) being
frustrated of the fortune Avhich Avas his by
every law, "human and divine.


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin could with perfect sincerity
serve his uncle's interests, as far as Florestan
de Nesves was concerned, and there was no
difficulty in answering for the perfect innocence
of Claudine, in Avhatever concerned that young
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 42 -->
gentleman. Olivier did clear up everything in
the direction first taken by his uncle's
suspicions, and yet the suspicions (self-sufficing
seemingly) Avere not dispelled. Florestan de
Nesves on the other hand was too useful a
blind for the sagacious Aspasie (and she was
necessarily always consulted) to agree to his
being totally banished, so that Olivier could
only resort to a treatment of him so light, that
{empty}M. de Moranges could not persist in regarding
him as dangerous. Olivier admitted that
Florestan admired Claudine immensely, but he
pledged his honour and credit (as well he might!)
that she barely noticed the fact of his existence.
And then—foolish people being for ever foolish

—Olivier Avent too far, and said the un wisest
thing he could have said, though he did not
guess why it was so unwise: he said that
indeed the conduct of the Sphinx Avas so
irreproachable, and her allegiance to the Marquis
so imperturbable, that it had got to be a joke at
the clubs that any one who should really wish
to pay court to her Avould have to do so before
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 43 -->
{empty}M. le Maire, and M. le Cure, in the exercise of
their functions.


"Good God!" cried the Marquis, "do
you mean to say that Nesves would marry
her."


\"Oh! my dear uncle, I didn't say that! "
had been Beauvoisin's reply. " I only said it
was quite a club-joke on account of Madame
Claudine's conduct being so very proper," (lie
called her Madame on these occasions, and
thought that a stroke of policy).


And still M. de Moranges doubted and
feared—he kneAV not what. He Avas misled as
to the man, not as to the thing, and the truth
had hit him, and hit him hard. The
magnificent Marquis Avas full of anxiety, and had
lost his faith in himself.


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, like all weak, undecided
natures, was for ever internally complaining,
either of his bad luck, as he called it, or of
somebody's bad behaviour to him. He thought
himself so hardly dealt by! When he was
away it was all very well, and he was
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 44 -->
persuaded it would be the easiest thing in the
world to break loose from the Sphinx; but
Avhen he got back into her atmosphere, he had
no longer any Avish to break loose from her,
but found himself momentarily very Avell off,
and quieted his alarms by thinking that, after
all, things might go on as they Avere, and that
they Avould come to an end of themselves
somehoAv. Oh ! that " somehoAv! " what a
part it plays in the lives of these purposeless
men !


As usual, our friend Aspasie Avas in reality
the guiding star of these two destinies. So
long as she did not attempt to take the
Sphinx's plaything from her, she ruled supreme
over Claudine, as over Olivier; but several
"feelers" put out by her had caused her to
perceive that a reckless outbreak would ensue
if she made the slightest move toAvards
snatching its doll from the infant. Mile. Mourjon Avas
out of patience with Claudine, and puzzled as
to how she should play her OAvn game. She
could not let Olivier escape, that was clear;
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 45 -->
for the Sphinx, once grown desperate, would
reveal everything, and her (Aspasie's) fortunes
would be marred, both with the Dowager and
with M. de Moranges.


She must go on, therefore, plotting and
combining, and preventing a crisis, and Avhat
she termed devoting herself (!), all which
constituted no small amount of hard work, and
really left no leisure AvhateA'er to poor Mile.
de MourjonA-ille.


The most amusing part of it all (and it did
divert Aspasie when she thought of it) was,
that her cleverness Avas such a relief to M. de
Beauvoisin's sIoav Avit that, although he feared
her mortally, and although she morally sat
upon him like the old man of the sea, and
was never to be shaken off, yet in his worst
moments of perplexity she alone could cheer
him up, and by her sharp, comical vein of
humour, induce him to come to the agreeable
conclusion that everything AAras " no matter."


One person alone was troubled by what was
passing, and that person Avas Count Dupont.
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 46 -->
As Mile. Mourjon thoroughly appreciated his
intelligence, she took the best possible care that
he should obtain no insight into her game; but
Henri's vigilance was not altogether to be
deceived, only it Avent astray too, and tended
towards an erroneous aim. A word or two,
dropped in joke by M. de Moranges months
ago, recurred to him, and he asked himself all
at once if the witty and practical minded Mile.
Aspasie might not be in some degree dangerous
for Olivier. His fears pointed principally to
the latter's purse, but not exclusively, for he
Avas quite aware that a woman of her kind may
absorb and totally subjugate a man of Olivier's
species.


Count Dupont busied himself with
discovering all he could touching Mile. Mourjon's past,
and, Avhen he had collected a certain sum of
details, he resolved he would take an
opportunity of satisfying himself as to the real state of
affairs between Mile, de Mourjonville and
Olivier. One day chance served him : he had
called at the Hotel Moranges and been
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 47 -->
admitted (as he thought he perceived, to Mile.
Aspasie's decided annoyance). They were
alone, Claudine being shut up in her room
with a headache; one of those eternal
migraines women are so peculiarly subject to in
France.


Henri Dupont made himself so pleasant that
Mile. Aspasie was thrown off her guard, and
showed to great advantage, and for tAventy
minutes these two chatted aAvay in apparently
perfect good fellowship, and spent between them
no inconsiderable amount of wit.


Suddenly, but always in the most playful
tone:—


"Why did you never tell me you Avere
Camille Leblond's sister ?" asked Count
Dupont, looking his adversary straight in the
face.


"I am not so," replied Aspasie, hurriedly,
and with decidedly a slight, though well hidden,
embarrassment.


"What!" cried he, and his look said
unmistakeably : " You can't take me in ! "
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 48 -->

"I mean," rejoined the lady in waiting,
"that I am not her sister, only her half-sister;
you know, however much one may be above
puerile prejudice, one does not blazon forth
certain relationships. Poor Camille ! I'm sure
I have no desire to be hard upon her, but still
when one is a respectable person, and
belonging to a respectable family" (this Avas an
inevitable allusion), " one does feel deeply certain
things. I may marry one day, and I should
hardly Avish that, before knowing me Avell, an
honest man should be informed of my
connection with a person like Camille."


All this was said with such consummate art,
Avith such a mixture of frankness, and propriety,
and humility, and common sense, that Dupont
dicl not quite know Iioav to continue his
examination.


Aspasie saved him the trouble: " It is a
very difficult thing for men of the world like
you," she said, unaffectedly, "to realise the
position of women like me. Your habits lead
you among people whose situations in life are
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 49 -->
clearly defined, and mostly above any struggles
(unless the struggles of ambition): in your
Avorld there is but little compromise: people
are of it, or out of it; if of it, you excuse
everything; if out of it, you ignore or
condemn. You clo not stop to take into account
Avhat the trials may be, nor if they are honestly
overcome; it is not a fair way of
dealingaccording to my estimate, and it is one which
I should have almost thought you Avould
avoid."


Henri Dupont felt himself put in one moment
altogether in the wrong, and very much in the
case of the man Avhose " Tartar " refused to be
"caught."


He had, after a certain fashion, to excuse
himself, which is a fatal proceeding when
you have intended to carry all things before
you.


However, Mile. Aspasie was eminently
goodnatured, or seemed to be so, and bearing no
malice, readily went into particulars concerning
her birth, parentage, and education.  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  E
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 50 -->

She expatiated on the vicissitudes of life, on
the hardships of women, on the helplessness
which had made her mother marry a second
time, and marry beneath her; and the amount
of her indulgence towards her half-sister kneAV
no bounds. She was all mercy and charity,
and not cantingly so. It Avas her moderation
and reasonableness that left Henri Dupont so
at a loss to find fault with her. He could only
folloAv her lead, and seem to take a lively
interest in Madame Theophile Mardonnet (nee
Leblond), and all at once a few words of
Aspasie's gave him an interest in this lady.
She had alluded to her early fascination for
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, and Henri asked her rather
eagerly whether she was sure they had never
met since Mardonnet's return.


Aspasie smiled : " My dear Count Dupont,"
she said, " you may think as lowly as you like
of people of Avhat you call ' our class,' but
there are some feelings which are the same
in all, and I do not fancy that Madame
Mardonnet or her husband would like to meet
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 51 -->
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, since what passed in earlier
days. My brother-in-laAv" (she added this
with much quiet dignity, and did not evade the
parentage with the "Deputy") "is a very
worthy man, in spite of his weakness (for it
was a weakness) in marrying Camille, and I
dare say poor Camille will lead a very
exemplary life in the end."


"Her husband was desperately in love with
her, I fancy," said Henri, in a way which made
Mile. Mourjon imagine he knew more than
she was aware of. Frankness appeared to be
her cue, and so looking Count Dupont in the
face,—


\"I have a great mind," said she, with sudden
animation, " to tell you the Avhole story of Avhat
occurred seven years ago."


"I think I know it," he replied, and
regaining somewhat of the ground he had
lost.


"I will venture to say you do not," retorted
Aspasie, warmly; "I'll venture to say that
you are in perfect ignorance of the obligations  
  
  
  E 2
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 52 -->
that M. de Beauvoisin owes to my
brother-inlaw."  
  
  
  Count Dupont stared at Mile, deMourjonville.


\"Yes," she repeated, " obligations, and very
serious ones too: listen. The Marquis de
Beauvoisin thought himself in love with poor
Camille, who was a reigning beauty then (and
such a child!), and, as you Avell knoAV, he was
under age, and could dispose of not one
farthing. Well! I suppose he contrived to
borrow small sums from one person and
another, but one day he got into a mess.
Camille's poor, little, silly head was turned by
a certain set of pearls and emeralds she had
seen in Marrefs windoAv, and probably her
youthful adorer guessed what Avould be the
power gained over her by whoever presented
her Avith the jeAvels. Their price Avas sixty
thousand francs. Well, one fine morning they
Avere given to her by M. de Beauvoisin! "  
  
  
  (Count Dupont listened unmoved.)  
  
  
  Aspasie, after an imperceptible pause, went on.
<!-- Leaf 63, Page: 53 -->

\"I need not tell you he had done what many
a young man in his situation has clone before
him; he had signed bills for the amount at
three months date, and when the date came he
had not the shadoAV of a resource Avherewith to
meet his engagements. Theophile Mardonnet
got that money for him, and saved M. de
Beauvoisin from severe annoyance, if not from
disgrace."


\"I knew all that," observed, tranquilly,
Henri Dupont. "Are you quite sure that is all
that occurred at that epoch."


Before the hard interrogative look that
Count Dupont fixed upon her, while uttering
the above words, a slight flush and a slight
tremor seemed to pass over Mile. Mourjon's
face and figure, but perhaps it might be the
flickering flame of the fire by Avhich they were
sitting. It was so slight.


\"All ? " echoed Aspasie; " all ? why, surely
it is enough. I really do not know Avhat in
your station is regarded as disgrace, or what as
a service; but I, in my humble sphere, should
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 54 -->
have felt the deepest gratitude for any man
who had done to my son or brother Avhat my
brother-in-LiAv did for M. de Beauvoisin."


"Mardonnet Avas paid, I presume, capital and
interest," remarked Henri Dupont.


"And interest of interests," added Aspasie;
\"for you forget that he had to pay heavy
interest himself for more than two years, on the
sums he borroAved."


\"And you think that Avas really all ? " said
again Count Dupont.


\"What else could there be ? " inquired Mile.
Mourjon.


Count Dupont looked her through and
through, and then said,—


\"I'm sure I don't knoAV, but I thought
perhaps you dicl."


When their conference Avas over, Henri felt
that he had failed to find any confirmation for
his notions of even the merest flirtation
between Olivier and Mile, de Mourjonville. She
was disappointed, for she had decidedly not
succeeded in impressing Count Dupont with
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 55 -->
  
  a sense of the obligations conferred on
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin by her brother-in-law, the
Deputy.  
  
  
  
Long after Henri had gone away, she sat
gazing at the fire, and seemingly brooding over
some subject not particularly pleasant.
<!-- Leaf 66 -->
  
  CHAPTER V.  
  
  
  FOR EATER.


{empty}M. de Lancour had been nearly three
months absent, and the end of January was
approaching. The weather was unusually hard,
even the Seine being frozen over, so that, to
quote the words of Henri Dupont, both Avinter
and its pleasures set in with extraordinary
severity.


Never had there been such hard Avork
knoAA'n, in the way of balls aud raouts as
our neighbours term them, and the din and
roar created by the rotation of Fashion's wheel
as it went whirring perpetually round was
enough to deafen any reasonable mortal.


Claire took her fair proportion of all this
so-called amusement, and Avent to all the
entertainments of Avhat Paris calls its society,
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 57 -->
adding thereto the receptions and balls of
the Corps Diplomatique, which was a kind of
concession.


From time to time M. de Beauvoisin
accompanied his wife, and theu- behaviour to each
other was uniformly marked by great
kindness on her side, and an unmistakeable
deference on his.


One night, at a concert at the Due de
Vivienne's, the talk was everywhere of the
expedition to Algeria. Such glory had been
achieved ! such deeds had been done! no one
spoke of anything save the bulletins received
that morning. M. de Lancour's name was in
everv mouth, for to him reverted a lar^e
portion of the brilliant success achieved. The
troops under his orders had mainly decided
the first day's victory, and to the Avise as well
as daring manner in which he had led his men
was attributable the important result obtained.
Victor had been promoted to the rank of chef
d'escadron, and Avas the youngest "
commandant" ofthe African army.
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 58 -->

\"There now, " said M. de Beauvoisin, " see
how people are always wrong to want to
meddle with other people's affairs. Why,
when Victor would go off to Africa last autumn
all of a sudden, what a row all our people
made ! I never heard the last of it. He was
'restless,' and I don't know what all besides,
and now only just see how right he was; he
knew what was best for him; and that's what
I always say; a man may not be a genius, but
he always knows what suits himself better than
other people do. Besides, Victor is out and
out the finest fellow in the whole world."


After this for him tremendously long speech,
Olivier took breath, yawned, and thoroughly
exhausted, subsided for the remainder of the
evening.


Claire, unnoticed, stole towards the
conservatory, and, as the second part of the concert
was just beginning, found herself there alone.


She seated herself by one of the windows,
and the heat indoors being great, and the
odour of the plants oppressive, she opened it
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 59 -->
and looked out into the dark blue starry
night.


Stars were everywhere, on both canopy and
carpet; for the spotless snow, spreading over
the wide spaces of the garden, replied in
sparkles to the bright glances of the thickly
strewn jewels of the sky. And oh! how full
was the void of that still night with one image,
and how loud was its silence to Claire's heart
with one name!


She crossed both her hands over her knees
(it was a favourite attitude of hers) and sat
hushing the deep joy within her.


From the distant music-room, sounds floated
unhindered by any earthly presence to her ear:
came as though wafted down to her from the
fathomless sky. Here and there she caught,
almost unconsciously, a word; once the cry of
Addio in the Miserere of the Trovatore, and
then only sounds vaguely sweet; the crystal
tones of Nilsson, ringing out bell-like a Swedish
air, or the wild wailings of one of Chopin's
mystic melodies. Every nerve in Claire quivered
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 60 -->
to the immaterial touch of what surrounded
her, and snow, stars, and the air of the night
and the breath of leaves and flowers, and
the sounds of music, all spoke to her soul
with a direct meaning, and awoke responsive
vibrations.


As, forcibly combating her dream, Claire
rose to go, there came, borne to her on a voice
of strangely penetrating beauty, the words,—  
  
  
  Se divisi fummo in terra  
  
  
  Ne congiunga il nume in ciel!

She stood still for one second, and an inward
echo repeated over and again the plaint of the
lover of Lucia.


Yes ! they had been divided upon earth, but
why should this impress her so mournfully
now?


That night, as the young Marquise laid
down to rest, she still heard the words—  
  
  
  Se divisi fummo in terra,

and felt as though some warning were
conveyed to her.
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 61 -->

For many days in the infinitely small world
which styles itself magnificently the great
world, the expedition against the Kabyles, and
the glory achieved by Victor de Lancour were
the all-engrossing subject of conversation.


The expedition was only just in its
beginning; the first two or three days of it were
crowned with the most brilliant success, and
then the corps d'armee had to penetrate into
some defiles, reputed very dangerous, and to
track the enemy among his mountain
fastnesses.


For nearly a week there came no more
bulletins, and then there came one short
telegram. The advanced guard had fallen
into an ambush, and it was feared might have
sustained some losses.


Madame Beaudouin was sitting by her fire
reading—it was not much past noon—when
the young Marquise, unannounced, as was
frequently her wont, came in. She did not
kiss her aunt, nor take her hand. She merely
came np to where she sat, and said to her:—
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 62 -->

\"Aunt, was not the Minister of War a great
friend of your husband's ? "


\"Yes, dearest, he was so," replied Madame
Beaudouin, struck by the rigidity of Claire's
manner, and by the harsh brevity with which
she spoke; "he owed everything to M.
Beaudouin ? "


\"Are you still friends with him?" pursued
Claire.  
  
  
  " Most intimate friends."


\"Then, aunt, go to him at once; have a
carriage called" (and she stretched out her
own hand and rang the bell) " and make him
tell you the truth, about this telegram" (she
took a newspaper from her muff, and gave it
to her aunt), " the whole truth, aunt," she
added, with almost stern insistance, " Go now,
at once." (A footman opened the door, and
Claire bade him call a carriage; at which the
man looking astounded, " there is no time for
my aunt to wait for her own horses," said she,
sternly.)  
  
  
  Madame Beaudouin rose, feeling that her
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 63 -->
niece must be obeyed, and in five minutes she
had caused bonnet, cloak, and all necessary
wrappings to be brought, and was ready to do
Claire's bidding.


\"I will wait for you here, aunt," added
Claire, when the fiacre was announced; and
then she did take her hand, and wrung it.


\"Make him tell you all, aunt," she said, in
still the same unpleasant tone—but then
suddenly the voice sank—" tell you who—tell you
who—" she repeated it twice over, trying to
complete the sentence, but could not.


So Madame Beaudouin went, and Claire
waited; and two hours elapsed. During
those two hours the young Marquise never
stirred, — scarcely seemed to breathe. When
she heard her aunt come back, and the porte
cochere open to receive her, all the blood left
her face, and her lips parted in a gasp.


Madame Beaudouin was so long in coming
in to that room again, where Claire was
waiting for her.  
  
  
  And when she did come, how poor was all
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 64 -->
language compared to the heart's instantaneous
intuition!


Claire stood where she was, mute, tearless,
stunned. Yes ! by God's infinite mercy,
numbed to what it was beyond her natural
strength to bear.


It was the same story; and twenty years
rolling backwards bared Aunt Clementine's
wound as though Raymond de Varades were
freshly dead; and this very freshness of grief
it was in Madame Beaudouin that unlocked
the hardbound currents of Claire's woe, and
melted her stern sorrow.  
  
  
  The first word that passed her lips was


\"Mine! mine now, for ever! mine, before
all the world ! "


And then, shaken by convulsive sobbings,
Claire wound herself round her aunt, and
clung greedily to her who had suffered as she
was suffering.


Evening was closing in, and Madame
Beaudouin felt that Claire could not, nay,
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 65 -->
ought not, to return that day to her husband's
home. She, simple and true as she was,
resorted to her first subterfuge, and it did not
come easy to her; but Claire must be first
thought of! So she sent a few lines to Olivier,
saying she was very ill, and had ventured to
accept his wife's offer of spending the night by
her side.


That done, she retired to her own apartment
with Claire, and through her maid gave out to
her own establishment that a sudden attack of
acute neuralgia confined her to her room.


And what a night they passed, those two
loving, lonely women. A night in which the
communings of soul with soul were so
immediate that words were all superfluous. One
word alone seemed to have any sense for
Claire, and through all her agony recurred
perpetually to her lips.  
  
  
  " Mine ! mine now!


And when towards the dawn tired nature
gave way, and Claire, letting her head droop
upon Aunt Clementine's lap as she sat on the  
  
  
  VOL. III. F
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 66 -->
  
  floor at her feet, closed her eyes in fitful

sleep :  
  
  
  " Mine only ! mine for ever!" she murmured

in a low whisper.


The next day grief had to be combated, and
duty to be obeyed. The duties of the mother,
and (whether she would or not) of the wife—
for such she was before the world—asked for
Claire back, and Claire went and did her duty,
for Aunt Clementine said to her that the more
bravely she behaved the more worthy she
would be of him, and the nearer to him; and
she steeled herself to do all that he would have
wished done by the woman he loved.


As she was crossing her aunt's threshold to
return to her own home, she stopped, and,
putting her arms round Madame Beaudouin's
neck: " Aunt," she said, in faltering accents,
while a flush of the deepest crimson mantled
over her every feature; " Aunt, I should so
like, now " and she hesitated, " I should so
like to see her." And with eyes swimming in
tears, and in a tone of entreaty, " Think what
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 67 -->
lier agony must be," she added; "foi- she loved
him, aunt; dear, dear aunt: ought not I to
comfort her?"


Madame Beaudouin strained her niece to her
heart in a long silent embrace, saying gravely,
■" I will go to her, darling; and, when I have
spoken with her, we will go together."  
  
  
  •F 2
<!-- Leaf 78 -->
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  LIGHTLY LOVING, LIGHTLY LOST.


When Madame Beaudouin went to Madame
de Mottefort's door, she was informed that she
had gone to Versailles, where a cousin of hers
lived who had never entirely ceased to hold
communication with her, but used to pay her
visits from time to time.


At the end of a fortnight Berthe returned to
her Paris abode, and Madame Beaudouin
immediately set forth upon her charitable errand
to the misguided and doubly-stricken woman.


She did not give her name, but merely said
she wished to see Madame de Mottefort upon
particular and pressing business. The latter
begged her to wait a few moments till she had
finished dressing.  
  
  
  Aunt Clementine was shown into a small
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 69 -->
drawing-room, prettily furnished, but where no
one single object was remarkable for good
taste, and in which it seemed, to Madame
Beaudouin, that there were traces of impending
departure. The flower-stands were empty; in
the bookcases only here and there a stray
volume was left on the shelves, and in one or
two places on the walls a nail stood out forlorn,
and a darker patch of colour showed where a
picture had hung.


"Poor woman!" thought Madame
Beaudouin, " she probably longs to escape from
whatsoever recalls his memory, and bears
witness to the hours spent together! "


A door opening behind her gave passage to
a young, handsome, elegantly dressed woman,
but upon whose countenance sat no trace of
misery unbearable. She was not in mourning,
which fact escaped her visitor's notice at first.
The bearing of the two was singularly different :
whilst in Berthe's manner there was the polite
reserve with which one mere woman of the
world meets another who is a stranger to her,
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 70 -->
and in her eye lurked a glance of something
almost akin to suspicion,—Aunt Clementine
obeyed solely the impulse of a thoroughly
unworldly nature, and sought to bring
consolation where she supposed there was deadly
suffering. Without a word she went up to
Berthe, and taking both the latter's hands in
hers, gazed at her tenderly, tearfully, and
mutely offered her such pity as angels give.


Madame de Mottefort felt that she was in the
presence of a woman different from any she had
ever known, and, blushing deeply, cast down
her eyes, embarrassed.


\"Poor child ! poor child !'' they were the
first words that passed Madame Beaudouin's
lips, and then, "lam Aunt Clementine," she
added, simply. "My brother was his uncle,
and we all loved him so dearly!" and
opening her arms, she embraced Berthe, who
still seemed not quite at home with her visitant.


Madame Beaudouin's was one of those
straight, simple natures that are completed by
sorrow. Her whole life had been lived so
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 71 -->
apart from the ordinary world, so exclusively
divided between self-devotion and one grief,
that to the unconscious grandeur of her soul
all things grand came home. From the
constant habit of measuring things by an Infinite
standard, she had grown to be lenient to much
that shocks the world, and to be only severe
to such derelictions as it takes not into account.
To her, Berthe de Mottefort, who had
renounced the world for the sake of the man she
loved, was not an object of Pharisaical loathing,
as she was stated to be to the dainty dames
who reputed themselves virtuous because they
kept upon good terms with the world; she
was an object of intense commiseration, because
she had sacrificed herself. And poor dear
Aunt Clementine, who was a genuine Christian,
and did her best and utmost to follow her divine
Master's teachings, thought that if he could be
so pitiful towards the woman whom he told to
"go and sin no more," it was not incumbent
upon her, a weak human creature, to be
relentless.
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 72 -->

She recognised in her own heart that one of
the secrets of her own strength had been the
boundless love which would not ever have
permitted her to sink in the esteem of him she so
infinitely loved, but she could comprehend a
love that should be unlike this, and that,
wanting in pride, should unhesitatingly cast
away everything at the feet of the beloved.
Who told her this might not even be the better,
humbler nature ? It was not for her to judge;
and, therefore, instead of looking down upon
this poor sinful one, or feeling in the least
degree preachful towards her, she went to her
in sweet, loving mercy, and, with arms and
heart opened, sought to prevent her from feeling
utterly cast out from the communion of her
more deserving (or it might be luckier) sisters.


In affairs of the heart—in affairs, namely,
where the heart is in any way brought into
play—no one ever cheats another long; and
the mere contact of Aunt Clementine sufficed,
for a reason which perhaps might not at first,
be divined, to embarrass Madame de Mottefort
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 73 -->
she felt herself esteemed beyond her deserts,
placed in a position which she did not know
how to keep up.


Berthe acknowledged Madame Beaudouin's
superiority over herself, long before her own
inferiority became evident to Madame Beaudouin.


"Poor child!" repeated over and over the
latter, and making Berthe sit down beside her
on a sofa, she continued to hold her hands in
her own, and to speak words of tender comfort
to her, to still her sorrow as it were, as a
mother tries to still the wailings of some
motherless infant. It did not at first occur to
Madame Beaudouin to ask herself whether the
overwhelming sorrow was really there? She
had passed through her own fiery ordeal, and
was now living it over again in Claire's misery,
and the image of their own " agonies unto
death " shut out from her vision any possible
picture of pain more easily endured.


She had drawn Madame de Mottefort into
telling her own story of the past, thinking it
was kindest to give her the opportunity of
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 74 -->
presenting her own conduct in the least
unfavourable light, and of finding the utmost
sum of palliation for faults so terribly grave.
But somehow or other Berthe's account was
unsatisfactory, and Madame Beaudouin felt a
kind of disappointment at the comparatively
slight interest awakened in her by the tale of
a life full of such apparently moving incidents.
She accused herself of want of sympathy,
before she would admit that the fault lay with
Madame de Mottefort.


It was not that, in the story Berthe told
of her own troubles, there was anything you
would have been warranted in calling wrong:
the words were well enough—not the faintest
trace of a sentiment that could shock anyone,
not the shadow of an indelicacy of expression
—No! the words were all right, but somehow
the accent, the tone, the feeling that prompted
them was false. There was a want of gravity
in this woman who had assumed so grave a
responsibility upon herself; a want of
enthusiasm there, where the acts committed were
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 75 -->
those which should emanate only from an
enthusiastic nature.


Still Madame Beaudouin would not allow
herself to condemn.


\"You were unhappy at home," she said,
compassionately, when Berthe had told her of
her mother having died when she was a child.


\"I was very much hurt by my father's
second marriage," replied Berthe. "My
stepmother was young and good-looking, and of
course wished to appear to advantage, and dicl
not like a girl of fourteen or fifteen to look
after, and in a couple of years take out into
the world—it was natural on her part—I do
not blame her" (Aunt Clementine seemed at a
loss to understand clearly what this meant),
\"but it was a misfortune for me, and the only
way of getting rid of me was to put me to
school; there I staid till my marriage with
{empty}M. de Mottefort—I was seventeen."


"And your husband ?" inquired gently her
listener.  
  
  
  " He was thirty years older than me,"
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 76 -->
answered Berthe, and these words, plainly
spoken, but telling their tale truly, were pitiful,
and went to Madame Beaudouin's heart.


"Poor thing!" she murmured, and pressed
Madame de Mottefort's hand again tenderly;
\"and you did not attempt to make any
opposition to the marriage ? "


Berthe looked at Aunt Clementine as though
not exactly comprehending what she meant.


"I could not have attempted to oppose my
father's wish," she said, " for M. de Mottefort
was an unexceptionable offer; he was of an
excellent old family, had served with
distinction, was already a Lieut.-Colonel, and had
fifty thousand francs a year, besides hopes. I
could not have found a pretext for opposition."
Madame de Mottefort uttered these words with
such innocent frankness, that in her turn
Madame Beaudouin was embarrassed, and did
not know what to say.


\"I should not have dreamed of making any
opposition," resumed Madame de Mottefort;
\"besides, we lived very happily together"
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 77 -->
(this escaped her, and it was only as she caught
the strange look of Aunt Clementine's eyes
fixed upon her that she felt she had borne
witness against herself). " I had no complaint
to make against M. de Mottefort," she added,
in a lower tone, and looking down rather
confusedly; "he was very kind to me, and is a
most worthy, excellent man."


\"You had no children ? " inquired Madame
Beaudouin.  
  
  
  "Two," was the reply, with still downcast eyes.


Madame Beaudouin dropped the hand she
had hitherto held in hers.


\"You had two children ? " she echoed, in a
tone of voice so involuntarily reproving that
Berthe blushed scarlet.


\"My little girl died when she was four years
old," she rejoined, and tears began to trickle
over her burning cheeks; " my son is living,
and is between nine and ten years old."


\"The ways of Providence are hidden,"
observed Aunt Clementine, relenting at sight of
the mother's sorrow for the memory of her
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 78 -->
dead child. " It is not for us to judge; your
trials have been severe, poor woman, and
God's mercy is unbounded. You must have
suffered cruelly."


\"Cruelly, indeed!" repeated Berthe, raising
her eyes upwards, and giving way to a burst of
genuine grief the moment the chord of
selfcommiseration was touched. " The world is
so hard!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands,
\"so hard upon any unfortunate woman who is
carried away by her heart!"


Aunt Clementine was all mercy and softness
again at this, and put her arms protectingly
round Berthe's shoulders, pillowed her head
upon her bosom, and soothed and comforted
her, and let her cry her heart out. Poor
stricken woman ! had she not lost everything
that made life worth having? Was not he
snatched from her \.hom she had sinfully
worshipped and made her idol ?—and was she
not utterly alone ?—friendless and forlorn, and
bereft of all those compensations which the
unerring find in their neighbour's sympathy
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 79 -->
and in the favour of public opinion ? Did not
the world cast her forth? Did not the
socalled righteous condemn ? Where, then, was
this unfortunate to find a refuge if the really
pure-minded could not show themselves lenient,
and if Christian souls refused to remember how
all human weakness is liable to fall?


\"We must help you, my poor child,"
whispered Madame Beaudouin, with an accent
of maternal tenderness; " we must try to
guard you from despair. To the truly penitent
God always lends a willing ear, and never
refuses consolation to those who mourn over
their past faults; we will pray together; my
niece, Madame de Beauvoisin, will come to
you—she wishes to see you; and whilst you
deplore the sin, we will only remember the
sacrifice—we will only think of how you gave
up all for him."


\"Alas! I did indeed," exclaimed Berthe,
"with a fresh burst of tears.


And when Madame Beaudouin had calmed
this outbreak anew, she sought to induce
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 80 -->
Madame de Mottefort to speak with her of her
future plans.


She knew (for Berthe had already told her
of this) that she had, from her mother and
from her father also, an independent fortune of
her own, which, from the hour of her departure
from his house, her husband had, with the
utmost generosity, made over to her. Aunt
Clementine's notion was, that she should, after
a retirement of some months in a convent,
settle herself somewhere in the country, not far
from Combeville or Malleray, so as to be for
the larger half of the year within reach of
herself or of Claire. In her pure, simple mind,
the only thing remaining after the greatness
of the sin, was the greatness of the expiation.


\"You have renounced the world," she said,
earnestly; "but the world is always just in
the long run, and you may win its respect,
yet, by your repentance, my poor child;" and
thus saying, she bent down and imprinted a
kiss of holy forgiveness upon Berthe de
Mottefort's brow; " nothing is irretrievable "
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 81 -->
she added. " You were feeble in your resolves
against Victor, but you made the sacrifice,
you must complete it now, and hallow it; and
in your future road through life, you will find a
sister on either side. Claire and I will never
desert you, and as much as our humble efforts
may avail, we will help you to sanctify the
memory of the past, and regain your own
esteem."


Berthe receded from Madame Beaudouin's
embrace, and seemed as it were to shrink into
herself.


"You are very good," she murmured;
\"very kind, and I am deeply indebted to you
—but I cannot accept your offers of service.
I " she hesitated and found no words for
expressing what she had to convey; even her
dim morality realised the extent to which she
had been over exalted. She measured the
height from which she was about to fall, and
shuddered.


\"You, perhaps, crave for utter solitude,"
remarked Madame Beaudouin, coming to her  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  G
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 82 -->
aid; " it is natural, too; no one knows how
another takes grief, and each must tread his
own path towards atonement and consolation.
But remember that of Claire and of myself
you must learn to think as though we were his
sisters."


While Madame Beaudouin was speaking,
Berthe had been composing a part for herself,
which she now prepared to enter upon with
much dignity.


\"M. de Mottefort," she began, in a tone she
tried to render grave, but without venturing to
raise her eyes to Madame Beaudouin's face :
\"M. de Mottefort consents to overlook the
events of the last four or five years, and "
she paused, "I am going to return to my
husband," she added at last.


Aunt Clementine had shrunk from her now,
and stood, like one bewildered, staring at
Berthe with evidently no power of taking in
what she meant.


Poor Aunt Clementine! she could pity and
pardon all things grand and true, but the low,
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 83 -->
small, vulgar, motives of this vain
proprietyseeker scared her. The levity, the emptiness,
the want of truth everywhere, whether in the
sin or in the shame, wrung her very heart.


\"It is so much better," muttered Berthe,
incapable of bearing this silence; "for our
son; the world forgets in a few years; and,
then, for his sake,—it is so much better for his
sake." But she never looked at her, never,
once.


(" The world forgets !" Yes, Berthe, it
does; it asks for no better than to forget—but
you ! have you forgotten ?)


Aunt Clementine was overpowered by the
rush of her tumultuous thoughts. Her sweet,
pure, ardently-loving Claire, and that young
hero in Algeria, dead for duty and
renouncement's sake, they swept before her eyes,
mournfully indignant at the miserable creature
who had neither renounced nor loved. Was it
then true that in true passion alone lies the
strength of right doing; and that whilst the
pure may be passionate, the genuinelypasg2
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 84 -->
sionate must be pure? Oh, Raymond,
Raymond! you too arose before her, and forced
her into a vehemence no one had ever seen in
her before.  
  
  
  Going close up to Berthe,—


\"Had you no friend near you when you left
your husband for M. de Lancour ? " she asked,
in a voice that was quite unlike her own, and
that forced Madame de Mottefort to look at
her.


\"Oh, yes," answered Berthe, taking refuge
in talk; "I had one very kind friend, a cousin,
indeed, the same one with whom I have just
been staying, and who has seen my husband,
and reconciled us; she did her best, but, alas !
I could not help myself! " and she added some
details proving her friend's eager desire to save
her; but she always recurred to her
declaration that she "couldn't help herself:" and,
after prating for some seconds, whilst her

listener looked her through and through, " /
could not help myself" she concluded.  
  
  
  '•' I mean," retorted Aunt Clementine, " had
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 85 -->
you not one friend who told you you could"?
Not one brave enough to say to you, ' Woman,
that sin you can avoid !' not one who stood
in your way and drove you back, and told
you that nothing compelled you, and that you
could have easily resisted? My God!" she
cried, fervently, " is this the way souls are
lost ? " and, turning her back upon the
trembling woman, who crouched before her, she left
the room and the house.


The impression produced on Madame
Beaudouin was a singularly strong one; outwardly,
the strongest, she had ever received; for she
rose in revolt against Berthe de
Mottefort's levity, in the name of a whole life of
abnegation and of victory over passionate
love.


When she came to meet Claire, she could
only convey to her fitfully, and with tears of
indignation and pain, the bitter disappointment
she had endured. Claire had never seen her
aunt thus moved, and the flash of the eye, and
flush of the cheek, were those of anger—a
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 86 -->
feeling by which no one had ever beheld the
serenity of that calm, gentle face disturbed.


\"She never loved him," she cried; " and
incurred lightly all that heavy load of guilt!
Lightly! How merciful is God in having
taken her daughter from her. How could
such a woman teach a daughter to do right ?
Oh, Claire, Claire ! " she added; " that poor,
friendless, untaught creature who is with your
uncle Moranges, is less fallen than such a
woman as this."
<!-- Leaf 97 -->
  
  CHAPTER VII.  
  
  
  THE SILVER MEDAL.


The unworthiness of Berthe impressed the
young Marquise deeply, but pained her less
than it did Aunt Clementine; firstly, because
she was much younger, secondly, because a
comparatively greater mixture with the world
had familiarised her with certain inferiorities
in women; but, above all, because any default
in Berthe (especially of this kind) evidently
proved a lighter hold on Victor in the past
than she was supposed to have had. Claire,
bereft of the present and the future, had no
consolation save the past, and whatever
served to open its gates to her, closed as
they, too, had seemed by Victor's attachment
to Berthe, was greeted with ardently selfish
joy.
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 88 -->

Madame Beaudouin's words touching the
Sphinx had also struck her niece forcibly, and
she permitted herself strange questionings on
points which had hitherto been, in her mind,
placed absolutely beyond the pale of
speculation or doubt.


\"That poor, friendless, untaught creature ! "
had said Madame Beaudouin, when she
declared the Sphinx to be less unworthy than
Madame de Mottefort. That was a bold
assertion, for, after all, Berthe was a lady, a
person of Claire's own standing, and whom, as
things had now shaped themselves, she would
infallibly some day meet in that society which
was common to both, whilst no circumstance
that she could possibly imagine would ever
bring her together in the same salon with the
Sphinx. And at first these superficial ideas,
belonging to the conventionalities in which she
had been brought up, held their ground against
the innovators, and she could not descend to
discuss the more or less of guilt in women
whose infamous lives prevent their being taken
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 89 -->
into account, unless wholesale and as a class,
{empty}i.e., an abstraction.


But Aunt Clementine, who was purity itself,
had said, "poor, friendless, and untaught!"
and it was certain that Berthe de Mottefort,
who was going back to her husband, and who
would one day, with him, be again received by
the world, had never been friendless, was not
poor, and had been exceedingly well-taught.
Ought she not then to have been, under no
matter how hard a trial, the evident superior
of the miserable Traviata !


"Poor, friendless, and untaught!" Still
those words rang in her ears, and gradually
assumed a practical sense.


"Poor!" Well, but Claire knew of many
starving creatures, who, to their honour be it
spoken, were virtuous and good, and bore with
resignation an intolerable lot. Then, again,
"friendless!" Nobody was quite friendless,
there was always some one who cared for them.
And "untaught!" Why, that was not an
excuse, for learning was not required to make
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 90 -->
people honest, everybody knew the difference
between right and wrong; and Claire, with all
her natural high-mindedness, fell into the so
ordinary mistake of confounding the
acquisition of knowledge with moral teaching. But
hidden in her heart lay the bit of true ore that,
spite of her own imperfection, responded to the
magnet of her aunt's words. Might there not
be something to do ? some help to give ? The
question was that of a human soul—for,
degraded as the Avorst sinner may be, he is
possessed of a soul, and that is God's gift. If
really there were darkness, might not light be
let in ? If Christian truths had never been
Christianly brought home to this pariah, was
it now altogether too late ?


But what to do ? and how to do it ? It is
not difficult to rescue the indigent; you rest
your morality upon your money, and the
chances are in your favour, at all events,
apparently; but it is none so easy to persuade
the rich that they need rescuing; and
whatever the Sphinx might once have been, she
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 91 -->
now ranked among the rich. She was neither
poor nor friendless now; she was living in
daily habits of luxury, far greater even than
Claire herself indulged in; she was, as far as
men were concerned, surrounded by whatever
Paris held to be most distinguished. The only
part, then, of Madame Beaudouin's argument
in her favour that held good was that she had
been untaught. But would she care now for
teaching, the first result whereof would be to
snatch her from her luxuriously indolent
existence? Berthe, the well-born, well-educated,
and in every way well-defended Berthe, had
been first false to her duty, and then false to
her love; she had resisted on no one single
point, why should this other woman be
stronger ? And supposing even there were, in
this more primitive nature, a larger amount
of plain rough worth, how on earth was Claire
to find any means of acting on it ? How was
it to be drawn forth ? Had the Sphinx been
starving in the streets, or dying on a hospital
pallet, Claire felt that she would have got up
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 92 -->
and gone to her forthwith, and fought with all
the arms she knew of, to save the unhappy
creature's soul. But she could not walk off to
the Hotel de Moranges, and by her teachings
and preachings carry off this lamb (supposing
her to be one) from the devourer—the devourer
being, too, her own uncle.


It was impossible, it would be so ridiculous !
and Claire, whose entire life was now fixed and
centred in one supreme absorbent grief, could
yet recoil before the idea of ridicule.


She was sorely perplexed, for like all women
of her kind in her present situation of heart
and mind, she longed for some deed to be
done, for some good to be achieved. As usual,
circumstances provided for her what she was
unable to provide for herself.


She was walking in an alley of the Bois one
fine bright forenoon, while the sun shone on
the snow-clad branches of the trees, and made
them glitter as though bestrewn with
powdered diamonds, when Count Dupont rode by.
She bowed to him; he caught sight of little
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 93 -->
Pierre, who, wrapped in furs and velvets, was
toddling along at his mother's side, and
dismounted. First they talked of the child, with
whom Henri Dupont entered into conversation,
cipropos of the icicles the little fellow wanted to
gather upon the trees, and gradually they were
drifting into the subject towards which Count
Dupont always laboured (but in vain) to bring
Claire, whenever they happened to be alone,
namely, Olivier. She at once let their talk
slacken, and her companion began to think of
what he should say next, or whether he had
not better beckon to his groom to bring his
horse back to him and ride off, when the
youngMarquise suddenly looked him curiously in the
face, saying,—


\"When you go to dine with my uncle
Moranges, the person who keeps his house for
him is always there, is she not ? " And then
she blushed deeply and looked down, as
though shocked at having to approach such a
subject.  
  
  
  " Always," replied Henri, certainly rather
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 94 -->
  
  surprised at hearing the Sphinx alluded to by

a woman of Claire's description.


\"And do you actually know her? " continued
the young Marquise.


"All Paris knows her," rejoined Henri, with
a smile.  
  
  
  There was a pause.


\"Count Dupont," recommenced Claire with
a kind of timid eagerness, " is that unhappy
creature so very—so irretrievably bad, do you
think?"


Henri stopped and looked interrogatively at
the Marquise.


\"Pardon me," he replied, " but in your short
phrase there are grouped together all the
anomalies into which people in our world
inevitably fall when they touch upon this
theme; they always go too far one way, or
too far the other : you either pity or condemn
too much. If you pity her enough to call her
unhappy, why do you speak of her as
irretrievably bad ? and if your conscience tells you that
her guilt is irretrievable, why do you pity
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 95 -->
her enough to call her unfortunate ? My dear
Marquise, I entreat of you to forgive me, but do
you make your inquiry of me merely as a
great lady who wishes to know something
about the manners and ways of these Dames
aux Camelias, or do you speak to me as a
Christian ? "


\"I speak to you as a Christian," answered
Claire in a low tone, and with an earnest look;
\"for as a Christian I am seriously desirous of
knowing what to think of this woman."


\"There is but little to say of her as an
individual," said Henri Dupont; " she is merely
one of her kind; a kind that, unless societ}*
goes to work quite differently, will grow more
numerous from year to year; but if you are
not prepared to admit that something should
be done to save these wretched women as a
class, I should be at a loss to show in what
particular way this one is deserving of interest.
She is for the moment well cared for materially,
which many hundreds (or indeed thousands)
of her species are not, and she has a chance of
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 96 -->
something in the future, for your uncle is far
too thorough a grand seigneur to allow her
ever to be in want."


\"But what I meant," interrupted Claire, with
a mixture of persistence and hesitation, " was,
whether she was aware of her shame ? whether
she might not be saved yet? whether"—she
paused—" what I mean, Count Dupont, is, do
you think she likes her position ? "  
  
  
  Henri smiled a curious smile.


\"I am afraid she does," he replied, shaking
his head; " they all do, when it is so
comfortable a one as hers."  
  
  
  " How horrible ! " ejaculated Claire.


\"Yes; it is horrible," resumed Henri
Dupont; " horrible in the extreme, to think of
crowds of women in our civilised, self-satisfied
old Europe, being forced into sin by destitution
and ignorance, by the starvation of their bodies
and their minds—that is appalling,, and cries
aloud to heaven."


\"But they are taught their religion," objected
Claire.
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 97 -->

\"No, they are not," retorted Count Dupont;
\"a certain number of precepts and tenets are
set down for them, and they repeat them,
learn them by rote, but nine times out of ten
do not realise their meaning, and, ninety-nine
times out of a hundred, cannot apply them,
because they are helpless. My clear Marquise,"
he said, stopping in his walk, " this is one of
the subjects it is impossible to discuss with a
lady, because conventional terms alter their
meaning, and the words wrong and sin, and
whatever they imply, designate objects quite
different from those you apply them to. You
deal with the mere effect only, whereas the
cause is what will have to be dealt with—for
the question is the gravest one of our age—
but, now I come to advert to it, you ought, if
you take such a special interest in this one
unfortunate, to be able to find out easily all
about her, for she actually comes from your
own place."


\"What do you mean ? " cried Claire, eagerly;
"fromClavreuil?"  
  
  
  it  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 98 -->
  
  " No; but from close by, from St. Martin."
\"Good God ! how shocking ! poor girl! "


Count Dupont put his hand gently on
Madame de Beauvoisin's muff, and looking full
into her face : " Why is it more shocking," he
asked, gravely; " because she takes her origin
from your neighbourhood ? Why is she poorer,
and more to be pitied, because you may,
perhaps, know something about her
belongnigs i


\"I can't say—I don't know," answered the
young Marquise, blushing at what she
recognised as a well-founded reproach; " but you
must let me clo the little good I can (or try to
clo it) in my own way—what is her name ? "


\"Claudine—no; I am wrong there; her
real name is Madeleine, it was a whim of your
uncle's to make her call herself Claudine (he
didn't like Madeleine)."  
  
  
  " But Madeleine what ?


\"Ah; there you ask more than I know, and
yet, I have heard that too. Mile, de
Mourjonville once told me •"
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 99 -->

\"Who on earth is she ? " inquired the
Marquise, abruptly.


\"Oh, she is altogether another sort of
person," rejoined Henri, almost sternly; " of her
you never need know anything (she is the
factotum at the Hotel de Moranges), and she
certainly told me Claudine's name—it is
something like Reval—yes, Madeleine Reval, I am
pretty sure that is it."


That said nothing to Claire, and she knew
no more than before.


\"I had better write to the cure of St.
Martin," she suggested.


\"May be," rejoined Henri; " though for any
genuine, practical good he ever did the girl, she
might be an utter stranger to him."  
  
  
  " What age is she ? " inquired Claire.  
  
  
  " Not yet twenty."  
  
  
  The Marquise shuddered.


\"How dreadful," she added; "so young,
and so sinful; and probably now devoid of all
faith."  
  
  
  " Well," replied Count Dupont; " that is not  
  
  
  H 2
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 100 -->
for me to judge. In her strange dark way,
there is what some people call religion. She
likes going to church immensely, and mutters
a string of Aves in any danger or
emergency. She wears round her neck a little
silver medal of the Virgin, and would, I
believe, let herself be cut in pieces sooner than
part from it."


"Who gave it her?" asked Claire, in an
unsteady voice, and looking away to hide her
blushes.


\"She will never tell that," was the answer;
\"but she believes that medal is to preserve her
from everything, and heaven only knows what
extraordinary prayers she addresses it."


\"Count Dupont," said the young Marquise
after a rather long silence, and looking at him
with a sudden resolve of which he could not
guess the cause: "that poor girl must be saved
—but there is but one way to do it; my uncle
himself must be brought to see the truth; he
must give her up, and I will be responsible for
her future."
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 101 -->

Henri Dupont looked at Claire with an
expression in which surprise and curiosity combined
with a kind of compassionate admiration.


\"I am afraid no one will help you in that
crusade," he said; " your uncle Moranges is
not a man who has ever received advice from
any one, or ever renounced a plan or a whim
for the sake of anything upon earth; he may
question even your right to interfere."


\"I don't mind," retorted Claire with flashing
eyes; "I feel I am in the right, and I will not
yield. I will apply to my uncle himself. I will
go at once to my mother-in-law; she knows
her brother well."  
  
  
  " She will not help you."


\"Perhaps; but she shall admit that I am
right" (and she made a sign to the footman
behind her to call the carriage); " I will go to
her straight, and then I will speak to my uncle
myself, and I will leave no stone unturned to
save that poor unhappy girl."


Henri Dupont bowed low before her, and, as
he assisted her into her carriage, "You may,"
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 102 -->
  
  said he, " clo what no other woman could.
You may even succeed; but, rely upon it, it is
a far more difficult task than that of Una's with
the lion."
<!-- Leaf 113 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.  
  
  
  COMING TO THE POINT.


Claire drove straight to the house of her
mother-in-law, where the concierge allowed that
his mistress was at home, but where the
youngMarquise sought in vain for admittance. At
last, having obtained the intervention of the
Dowager's maid, this functionary delivered to
her, in answer to her message, a piece of paper,
on which the Dowager stated that business of
the most pressing nature prevented her from
receiving even her daughter-in-law; but that
she would go across to the Hotel de Beauvoisin
before dinner.


Claire was fain to be satisfied with this, and
so went her way.


The Dowager, in that dismal boudoir of hers
which we have already seen, sat grim and
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 104 -->
fidgety, looking at the fire, doing nothing, (a
rare thing for her !) and waiting for some one
or something with evident anxiety.


Very early that morning she had received a
note, which had palpably disturbed her, and
shortly after receiving which she had issued a
formal order to let no living creature in, except
a certain Madame Perrichon, who, she said,
would bring her some papers from the notary,
and who was not to be kept waiting one
instant.


The note stated that this person would come
at two o'clock.  
  
  
  It wanted now six minutes of the hour.


The Dowager's sharp eyes were riveted upon
the hands of the clock; and, though her
perpetual white wools lay upon her lap, her
fingers did not touch them, and the
longbright needles lay idle. Her metallic reserve,
as Henri Dupont delighted to call the
Dowager's hard-locked demeanour at any crisis, was
decidedly upset, and you might fancy you could
have heard the stifled sound of agitation within
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 105 -->
her, like the wild clickings of a watch whose
main-spring is broken. Some master chord
had been touched in that steely nature, and the
jar persisted still all over.


The hour struck, and appeared to strike
upon the Marquise Dowager, herself, for she
started and shivered. She was not nervous,
that same Marquise; no! neither
impressionable, nor sensitive, nor in any way liable to
feminine weaknesses. Yet it seemed to be
pretty much the same in the end; and the
series of small tortures through which she
passed during the space of ten minutes, were
probably equivalent to what ordinary people
feel when suspense racks their more delicate
nervous systems.


At last, the noise was heard of the porte
cochere turning on its hinges, and then came
the note upon the timbre, announcing a
visitor. The progress of the latter from the
court to the antechamber seemed a slow
one, if you counted it by the frowns and
lip-pinchings on the Dowager's countenance -y
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 106 -->
but, at last, the handle of the room-door
turned, and a lady dressed in black, and veiled,
entered.


\"You are late, Madame! " said the
Marquise, committing two mistakes before the
footman had made his exit; first, springing to
her feet, instead of remaining seated; and
next, showing with what impatience she had
been waiting.


"Am I so?" replied the veiled lady, in a
voice familiar to us.


\"Your note said two o'clock: I have waited
ten minutes."


"It is not always easy to dispose of one's
time," objected the new comer, as, laying aside
her veil, she discovered the semblance of Mile.
Aspasie.


\"It must be something exceedingly urgent
which could make you ask to see me here in
my own house," continued the Dowager,
allowing her ill-humour to carry her beyond the
limits of her habitual prudence; " incurring
such a risk ! "
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 107 -->

These closing words she mumbled, but her
visitor heard them.


\"Yes," rejoined, coolly, Mile, de
Mourjonville; " and perhaps, after all, I may have
allowed myself to be run away with by my zeal
in your service; for it almost seems to me,
now, as though I need not have been in such a
hurry. I will permit myself to take a seat, if
you please," she then added, parenthetically,
as, with an aplomb that well-nigh drove the
Dowager out of herself, she settled her skirts
upon a low chair near the fire, and deliberately
unfastened her paletot, half removing it from
her shoulders.


She made herself thoroughly at home, this
insupportable woman!


\"Well, what is it that you have to tell me ?"
broke forth the Dowager, still with more
impatience than courtesy. " What has happened? "


\"Are you quite certain that no one can hear?
that no one will come in here?" asked Aspasie,
quietly, and eyeing with immense satisfaction
the vexation of her opponent.
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 108 -->
  
  " All my orders are given "


"It is not always enough to give orders,"
suggested Mile, de Mourjonville, provokingly.


"Mine are always executed," retorted
Madame de Beauvoisin; "no one ever disobeys
me," and she rapped a very precipitate tattoo
upon the carved rosewood of her arm-chair,
with her bony fingers. " Now that you are
quite secure from all interruption, let me beg
of you to acquaint me with your reasons for

writing to me as you did this morning."


\"To say the truth, Madame la Marquise,"
began the undaunted Aspasie, " I am inclined
upon reflection to think I may have gone too
far. As I said just now, my zeal for your
interests led me away at first, and I fancied
something might be done to rescue your
unlucky brother; but the more I examine the
situation the less it seems to me that any plan
we can resort to will succeed, and my opinion
now "


\"I want no one's opinion, save my own! "
interposed, haughtily, the Marquise; " and I
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 109 -->
have long ago told you what that is. I will
not be trifled with," she continued, directing
towards her wily antagonist a look of anger,
that seemed to cause a secret amusement to
the latter. " You had something to
communicate to me, or you would not have sought
this meeting so suddenly here, in my own
house. I will know at once what it was."


The curiously cool and ironical look with
which Mile, de Mourjonville ventured to survey
her at this moment actually cut short her
phrase on the Dowager's lips. She had never
met man or woman who had thus gazed at her,
and she felt she had committed a mistake.


\"Our interests are the same," she added, in
a much softened tone; "it is obviously my
right to know all that passes, in order that we
may concert and advise together."


"Well," replied, dubitatively, Mile. Aspasie;
\"I will tell you all of course, if you wish it;
but on thinking it all well over, I incline to
believe we can do no good, and I shall
probably be only giving you needless annoyance.
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 110 -->
You see," (and at this entrance upon her
narration our friend indulged in a sly twinkle
in the corner of her malicious eyes, and a sly
smile in the corner of her malicious mouth),
\"you see it is never altogether safe playing
with fire, one does sometimes set one's
neighbour's house a-blaze or one's own. I did my
best to detach Madame Claudine from M. le
Marquis, and to attach her to somebody else;
and I had some reason to think that my
humble efforts would be crowned with success;
but a week or a fortnight ago, a report crept
abroad—whence it came I have never been
able to find out—that M. de Nesves was so
over head and ears in love with Madame that,
if she chose he would absolutely marry her!
This report "


But the Dowager would not allow Mile.
Aspasie to proceed. "Marry her!" she echoed
with what was all but a scream of rapture.
"Marry her! why that would be indeed a
triumph for us! My poor brother would be for
ever cured, and the duty he owes to his family
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 111 -->
and to my grandson would be performed
beyond all shadow of a doubt; what a
blessing ! " she fervently ejaculated,*laying her lean
hands quite affectionately upon those of her
visitor, on whose lips and eyes sat still the
same mocking smile.


\"Yes! no doubt, a great blessing," repeated
Mile, de Mourjonville; " but that is not
precisely what I had to say, if you had
allowed me to finish my sentence. I stated
that the report touching M. de Nesves, was
not traceable to any one in particular, to any
one Avhom I could make out; but it certainly
found its way to your brother's ears, and I
fear has caused him " she hesitated.


\"To turn her out of his house, and cast her
off before she has time to quit him ! " exclaimed
the Dowager with exultant hardness.


"N—o—!" drawled out Aspasie, shaking
her head, and distilling her every syllable with
the deepest enjoyment of the effect she
produced—" to think of marrying her himself! "
and, as it were, coiling herself up into the very
<!-- Leaf 122, Page: 112 -->
back of her chair, she sat watching her
opponent with an internal glee that pierced through
the mask of demureness imposed upon her
sharp features.


The fury of the Marquise knew no bounds,
and she raged, as such shut-up natures do
when once they break loose. (It was only the
third time in her whole life.) Mile, de
Mourjonville never took her eyes off her, and edging her
chair rather nearer to the fender, seemed, in
the way of personal defence, should such be
needful, to have reliance upon the tongs,
otherwise the scene apparently afforded her intense
amusement. The Dowager walked up and
down the room, stamped her foot, gnashed her
teeth, glared at Mile. Aspasie, with an
expression of fierce malignity that induced the
sagacious lady-in-waiting to draw several very
queer conclusions in her own mind, abused
her violently, and in general indulged in such
intemperance of behaviour and language, as
modified the notions Mile, de Mourjonville had
so frequently heard propounded upon the
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 113 -->
superiority of ladies of the world on trying occasions
over women of the other sort.


But as our friend Aspasie sat motionless
and mute, and merely watched the succession
of outbreaks of fury which were exhibited before
her, at the end of a given time these outbreaks
grew less violent, and the fury having exhausted
itself, the Dowager ended by coming to a halt
and dropping into the chair placed before her
bureau.


When silence seemed secured: "You see,"
began Mile, de Mourjonville, " that my
second thoughts were the right ones. I have
only caused you the most perfectly useless
anger and vexation by imparting to you my
suspicions."


\"If they had been suspicions only, you
would not have thought it requisite even to
acquaint me with them," interrupted Madame
de Beauvoisin, fiercely.


\"Well!" retorted Aspasie, with her irritating
smile, "if they were more than suspicions, it
was still less requisite to acquaint you with  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  I
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 114 -->
them—unless, indeed, you can point out some
means of preventing M. le Marquis de
Moranges from doing what he likes."


\"Listen to me once and for all," broke in the
outraged Dowager, " when you wrote to me
this morning you had a plan—don't attempt
denijils, I'll not hear them—you had a plan

—what was it? I tell you again I am not
to be trifled with."


"Madame la Marquise," replied Aspasie,
apparently quite free from the terror her
opponent was accustomed to inspire, but having
recourse to that frank simplicity of manner
which she had already once practised upon
Henri Dupont, and in the assumption of which
she was first-rate, "Madame la Marquise, I
am placed, or I should rather say I have
placed myself, in a most awkward, indeed in a
thoroughly false position. I have to appeal to
your indulgence, in fact."


\"Stuff! come to the point at once," growled
the Dowager.  
  
  
  " That is just what I am doing," replied
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 115 -->
Mile, de Mourjonville imperturbably, " and it is
precisely upon the point I am coming to that
I need your indulgence; for I do feel that I
acted too precipitately. I had reasons—strong
ones certainly—for believing in the danger I
have just pointed out to you. My first impulse
was to inform you of what was being planned;
I wrote my note to you last night, and after
everyone was in bed, slipped out at the garden
gate and posted it with my own hands. I acted
upon a first impulse and ■" she paused.  
  
  
  " Well," cried the Dowager, " what then ?"


"And I was wrong," answered meekly,
Aspasie.


The Dowager sprang from the chair by the
bureau, and flung herself down again upon the
one she had first occupied by the fire.


\"Why were you wrong, I should like to
know? "


\"Because I calculated upon what was
manifestly insufficient—I altogether mistook
the situation."  
  
  
  " More fool you, then;" burst from theMarI 2
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 116 -->
quise; "but pray what did you hear or see?
perhaps, after all, you have been falsely
alarming me? "


\"What I heard was a conversation between
{empty}M. le Marquis and M. de Sauveterre—-I could
not help overhearing it." (Aspasie did not say
that she had passed a whole hour with her ear
applied to the key-hole of the Marquis's
study.)


\"And you overheard my brother confide to
that abominable old man his intention to marry
this vile creature ! "  
  
  
  " I did ! "


\"Good God!" exclaimed the Dowager," what
are men made of? an infamous woman of
that kind! and to frustrate for her, his own
family, his own flesh and blood ! my grandson,
his rightful heir! My brother has still a far
larger fortune than I thought—I have been
into all the details—he has still one hundred and
fifty thousand francs a year to leave, mostly in
land—one hundred and fifty thousand francs
a year! " she repeated, clasping her hands
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 117 -->
almost in agony—" but it cannot be! it is
monstrous, some means must be found "


\"There is the very point on which I need
your indulgence, Madame la Marquise,"
interposed the ingenious Aspasie, " you yourself
utter now the very words which I uttered to
myself. I said to myself that something must
be done; that it was too monstrous; there
was my weakness, I avow it and implore your
pardon—I was precipitate—I acted on the
first impulse, and, when I came to reflect, I
could in fact find out no one thing in the world
that could be attempted. In reality for the
something to be done I had relied upon you."


"Upon me?" retorted the Dowager with a
sneer; " why, what in Heaven's name did you
imagine I could do ? "


\"I was weak, silly—unpardonably so,"
repeated Mile, de Mourjonville, "but I was so
confused at first that I did not take in the
position as it stands. By the time I had thought
it well out I could see easily enough that there
is no remedy—the thing must be borne—there
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 118 -->
is in fact no help for it; I only saw that too
late."


Both women sat looking at each other for a
considerable time in silence: the Marquise
boring into Mile, de Mourjonville's soul (if
she had any) with her screw-like eyes, and
Mile, de Mourjonville opposing to that process
the blank surface of a face as inscrutable as a
deal board.


\"One hundred and fifty thousand francs a
year," groaned the Marquise in her bitterness
of spirit, "and Brunoy and Moranges and all

—such things ought to be punishable by law,
for they are criminal. And no help! "  
  
  
  " None ! " repeated dismally the echo.  
  
  
  "He will leave her everything, of course."


"Or to her children," suggested the
comforter opposite. " I should think M. le Marquis
would be very fond of his son if he had one."  
  
  
  The Dowager bounded upon her chair.


\"Children ! " she cried; " that woman to be
the mother of my nephews! Is there no way
of making him see the infamy of his conduct?"
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 119 -->

"I do not think there is," replied Mile, de
Mourjonville, in a somewhat modified tone;
"but if there were, and if the marriage could
be prevented, I could not run the risk of losing
my situation at the Hotel de Moranges for the
sake of what would be insured to me as our
present little convention stands—the risk "


\"If the marriage were prevented," said the
Dowager, eagerly, " I would double the sum
gladly; it is two hundred thousand francs that
should be your reward."


\"Alas," resumed Mile, de Mourjonville,
shaking her head; " alas, Madame la Marquise,
your generosity need cost you nothing this
time, for there is nothing to clo. It is no use
deluding ourselves; Madame Claudine will be
Marquise de Moranges before a month is over
—unless, indeed, providence steps in."


"Oh! providence, indeed!" echoed the
Marquise, scornfully.


\"Well," continued Aspasie; " one does
sometimes see the most providential circumstances,
to be sure."
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 120 -->

"Yes, they may have no children," mused
the Dowager; "and then he may, perhaps,
not leave everything to her."


\"Or she may die," added Mile, de
Mourjonville, in the most natural tone, but never taking
her eye off the Dowager's face; " people clo
die sometimes very young, indeed."  
  
  
  " But she is very healthy, is she not? "


\"I should say strong rather than healthy,"
objected the accurate Aspasie.


\"Oh! poor thing," rejoined the Marquis
mere, suddenly moved to the most
unaccountable mercy and compassion towards her enemy.
"One must not wish for a fellow-creature's
death under any circumstances."


\"Of course not," replied Mile, de
Mourjonville; "and it is no question of wishing, God
forbid. I only said that one does hear
sometimes of even very young persons dying
suddenly."


"It is a remarkably healthy winter," pro
pounded the Dowager.  
  
  
  " Remarkably so," repeated Aspasie; "though
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 121 -->
they say there are a few cases of pernicious
fever about, and even of cholera."  
  
  
  " Sporadic," said the Marquise.


"No," said Aspasie; "Asiatic, but, indeed,
for that matter, doctors say there are always
cases of cholera about every year; however,
as you say, Madame la Marquise, it is a
wonderfully healthy season."


\"Wonderfully." And when they had talked
in a rather disjointed way for another ten
minutes, the two women took leave of each
other.
<!-- Leaf 132 -->
  
  CHAPTER IX.  
  
  
  TWO TO THE RESCUE.


To Claire's great disappointment, the
Dowager dicl not fulfil her promise of coming
to her that evening, neither did she assign any
reason for hot coming. The young Marquise
despatched a line to her early the next morning,
reminding her that she particularly desired to
see her; and the answer brought was, that the
Marquise Dowager had been prevented, the
night before, from going out by illness; but
that she would be with her daughter-in-law
immediately after breakfast.


The Dowager indisposed? Why, such a
thing had never been heard of! It was not in
the family annals, and Claire was plunged into
an astonishment bordering on stupefaction, upon
the announcement of the fact.
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 123 -->

When her mother-in-law paid her promised
visit after breakfast, there certainly were traces
of the indisposition of the day before, and the
pinched features and yellowed complexion of
the Dowager bore witness that something had
been disturbed in the usually even tenour of
her health. But upon that subject she would
not tolerate a single question, and tartly replied
that nothing was ever the matter with her.


But when Claire broached the subject upon
which she so ardently desired to consult her
mother-in-law, the latter flatly refused to have
anything whatever to clo with it. As to all
the young Marquise's arguments about human
souls, and higher duties, &c, &c, the
implacable Dowager laughed them to scorn, and told
Claire, moreover, that she was embarking upon
a most unseemly enterprise, and that such
infamous women as the Sphinx must be left to
their fate, that they were invariably better
treated than they deserved, and that it was the
height of impropriety to meddle with them in
any way whatever.
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 124 -->

In truth, the scheming Dowager was
considerably discomfited by her daughter-in-law's
communication; and what she most desired
was, to leave her brother in utter quietude of
mind, and perfectly untormented as to the
objectiomable personage to whom, she felt
certain, any premature or injudicious opposition
would make him forthwith offer his name and
fortune. She took good care not to make the
remotest allusion to the information she had
received the day before, touching her brother's
matrimonial projects, but dwelt on the
exceeding and never-to-be-sufficiently-reproved
impropriety of approaching the subject of the
Sphinx with M. de Moranges.


Claire, on the other hand, concealed from
the Dowager any knowledge she might have
had of Claudine, and all the particulars of the
wretched girl's visit to Clavreuil, and of the gift
of the little silver medal, which constituted the
link between herself and the outcast, and seemed
to impose upon her the special duty of rescuing
her miserable, sinful sister from perdition.
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 125 -->

Neither of the two made any impression
upon the other; and when the Dowager made
her exit, somewhat wrathfully, she left her
daughter-in-law as totally without help or
advice as to her contemplated campaign against
{empty}M. de Moranges as she had been before.


Still Claire was determined to do what she
thought right, but she certainly did not see
clearly Iioav to set about it. At one moment
she thought of consulting Olivier, but a very
little reflection sufficed to make her feel that it
was decidedly unlikely he should take a serious
interest in any woman's moral welfare, let
alone such a Avoman as the Sphinx. After
racking her brains to devise some plan, Claire
resolved at last to do what, had she been older
or more experienced, she Avould have clone at
first; namely, to write simply and
straightforwardly to her uncle, and beg him to come
and speak with her upon a matter in which she
took a great interest.


The note was written and sent, and the
answer brought, and M. de Moranges fixed to
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 126 -->
be with his niece the next day at one o'clock;
and then Claire thoroughly understood Avhat
a difficult task she had undertaken. Then all
the various objections she had heard recurred
to her, clothed in tenfold strength, and she
shrank from the accomplishment of what had
seemed so comparatively easy. The DoAvager
had stigmatised the step as improper, and
unbefitting a lady ! And Henri Dupont had held
it be of such immense difficulty that he openly
avowed he kneAV no one who would attempt
it. Then, in the face of the act itself, the
young Marquise, losing sight of all the loftier
considerations which raised it to the rank of a
duty, saw only the small inconveniences it
entailed, and the solecisms in strict good breeding
it necessarily enforced upon her. Hoav had
she dared take upon herself to meddle Avith
her uncle's private life? He was remarkably
kind and amiable to her, but there Avas no
real intimacy between them; and nothing
in all his bearing authorised her to take a
liberty with him; and she was about to take,
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 127 -->
of all liberties, the greatest that could be
conceived !


The young Marquise was filled with vexation
at what she now called her oavu rashness, and
Avould have given the Avorld to have been able
to get out of what seemed to her a tremendous
scrape.


When M. de Moranges entered her
drawingroom, and begged her to remark how punctual
he was in obeying her summons, Claire was so
embarrassed, that all trace had vanished of
that self-possession for which her uncle himself
had so lauded her. She spoke of several
indifferent subjects, and could not, for the life of
her, see her way to entering upon the one that
so deeply occupied her mind. At last,—


\"My clear niece," said M. de Moranges, in
the kindest tone, " you wished to speak to me
of something that interests you. I hope I
need not say that I am completely at your
orders; do not fear to ask anything of me.
It will be a pleasure to me to be of any use, or
to promote any object that is of interest to you."
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 128 -->

The young Marquise looked down, and,
blushing all over, "It is not for me," she
replied, in a low voice, " it is for you; my dear
uncle, pray do not be angry with me!" and
she looked beseechingly at him. " I feel Avhat
I am doing to be my duty; but it is a very
hard one, and you must promise not to be
angry with me; what I wish to speak to you
about concerns not me, but you."


\"Then all the more tell me everything
unreservedly," replied the Marquis, frankly and
affectionately; "be assured that I shall never
be angry with you."


"Uncle," began Claire, "have you ever
thought of the miserable condition of that poor
girl?" She hesitated, and M. de Moranges
looked as though he Avere miles away from
comprehending what she Avas driving at. " I
mean," she resumed, "that person who lives in
your house, and whom the fashionable world
has surnamed the Sphinx; have you ever
thought of the misery of that poor creature? "  
  
  
  "It is a strange subject for your lips, my
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 129 -->
dear niece ! " observed M. de Moranges, Avith a
curious smile, and an expression of countenance
by no means benevolent now; " but pray
proceed; what is it you have to say to me ? "


\"Oh, my dear uncle! " exclaimed Claire, her
courage returning with the re-aAvakened sense
of duty; "be merciful to the unfortunate girl,
think of her misery and her sin! think of her
soul for ever lost, and be generous towards
her! let her come back to the right road, clo
not stand in the way of her salvation!"


{empty}M. de Moranges laid his hand on his niece's
arm, uplifted in an attitude of entreaty, and
with a very disagreeable look,—


"Claire!" interposed he, harshly; "all this
is not your own doing: you are obeying the
promptings of some priest."  
  
  
  This restored Claire to herself.


\"Upon my honour, no! " she replied, firmly;
\"every Avord I have uttered comes from the
bottom of my OAvn heart only."


There was no doubting her for an instant.
Truth was stamped upon every feature, upon  
  
  
  K  
  
  
  TOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 130 -->
every look, and all traces of embarrassment
and shyness had disappeared.


\"So that," resumed M. de Moranges, " you
have spontaneously, and Avithout being put up
to it by any one else " (he accentuated every
word, and looked fixedly at his hearer)—■—


"Without being put up to it by any one, I
declare to you," repeated Claire, firmly.


\"You have of your own accord," continued
the Marquis, in the same tone, " determined
to penetrate into the most secret recesses of
my private life, and advise me for Avhat you
naturally term my good ? Claire ! " added he,
after a short pause, " I have never meddled
with your domestic life, never felt even the
slightest curiosity to know Avhat Avent on
behind the scenes; and that, simply because I
did not think it was any business of mine, and
because I hold a man's private life to be his
own exclusive property, and to be sacred from
the intrusion of no matter how near a
relation."  
  
  
  " Uncle," said Claire, " I feel the lesson you
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 131 -->
mean to give me, but do not be angry Avith me
if I say—I do not accept it. I do not wish to
interfere with you, still less to advise you, who
are so far, far wiser than I am. I merely come
to you as a supplicant, and humbly implore of
you to be charitable towards a fellow creature,
just as I would ask you for money to help the
sick or starving. Uncle! you must not be
angry with me—I ask your charity. I cannot.
—indeed I cannot—refrain from doing what I
think right;'' and as, with faltering voice and
tearful eyes, she uttered these last words, there
Avas such a modest earnestness about Claire
that M. de Moranges' rigidity of demeanour
began partially to give Avay.


\"You actually take, then, an interest in the
person you allude to ? " said he, in a gentler
tone of voice; " that is very pretty of you, my
niece," and he smiled.


\"What must I be," retorted Claire, " if
such misfortune did not touch me to the very
heart ? "  
  
  
  The Marquis got up, walked to the chimney,  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 132 -->
leant his back against it, and looked
scrutinisingly, but not in displeasure, at the young
Marquise.


\"My dear Claire, Avhat do you knoAV of this
person? " he asked.


She looked down someAvhat disconcerted,
and answered, blushing,—  
  
  
  " What everyone in Paris knows


"And," continued the Marquis, "that
constitutes in your opinion such an amount of
misery that you forthwith decide upon
straining every nerve to alleviate it: don't interrupt
me, pray : if Ave could go seriously into the
question (Avhich we cannot) there Avould be
matter for argument Avithout end, for we must
then reason consistently, and examine the fact
of the existence of the class, of the species—

the mere individual is nothing. I knoAV your
point of vieAv is the purely religious one; you
are convinced that the Avelfare of a soul is
imperilled : I—well! never mind what I think
upon that subject!—I will consent to believe
you perfectly sincere, and free from all clerical
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 133 -->
cant in the matter; but suppose I were to agree
to what you would ask of me: what would
you propose to do ? "


\"To rescue the poor girl at once ! " exclaimed
Claire.


\"That is, I presume," rejoined M. de
Moranges, " to make her exchange dainty fare for
coarse, fine clothes for ugly ones, and more or
less to shut her up in some holy place of refuge
or other, where she should only hear words of
sanctity, whether she were quite capable of
understanding them or not. It is mostly after
this fashion that this form of rescue is practised
upon the sinful."


\"Uncle," replied Claire, looking M. de
Moranges straight in the face, " you have me
at a great disadvantage, for you speak like a
man of the world, and a man of experience, and
I am utterly ignorant and have only my ardent
goodwill. I do not brave you, uncle, I appeal
to you: why will you not help me ? Think of
Avhat this poor young thing might have been—
she is not twenty yet, they say : think of what
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 134 -->
she will one day be. She might have been an
honest workman's Avife, the mother of children
avIio would respect and cherish her "


\"She AAras dying of hunger AAdien I took her,"
interrupted the Marquis impatiently.


\"And how much better it Avould have been
for her if she had died ! "


\"I beg your pardon, that is all nonsense,
sheer nonsense, umvorthy a woman of your
intelligence," retorted M. de Moranges; " she
thinks herself immensely the gainer, rely upon
that,"


\"And you call that honest, uncle?" asked
Claire, AA7ith a look that the Marquis evaded.
' You gave her stones for bread, and you knew
they Avere stones, Avhich she did not! Uncle !
uncle ! why not be generous, and help me to
save this girl?" and she had recourse again
to her sweet touching tones and beseeching
air.


{empty}M. de Moranges remained silent for several
minutes, apparently Avorking out some knotty
problem in his OAvn mind. At last,—
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 135 -->

\"My dear Claire," said he, " what Avould
you do to rescue that girl, as you call it ? "


She looked up at him Avith her bright, pure
look, and answered,—


\"If she were elsewhere than Avhere she now
is, I would go to her, and speak to her as sister
may speak to sister—teach her all I could—
teach her how she has sinned, and that all sin
may be retrieved; but, above all, force her to
feel that my OAvn heart sorrows for her fault,
and that her return to the right road would
make me happy. I would try to make her feel
that she is really, genuinely dear to me, as my
sister in Christ."


{empty}M. de Moranges looked with admiration at
his beautiful niece, whose whole countenance
gloAvecl with the purest and most holy
enthusiasm.


\"You are a sweet, dear girl, Claire," said he,
almost fondly; " and you clo truly love your
neighbour, but there, alas, lies the whole
mistake. The sinful, as you call them, may
sometimes be impressed by strong individual
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 136 -->
affection—earthly affection—which is what
you cannot give; and what you can give,
namely, the Christian love for the felloAV
creature, for the abstract neighbour, does not
touch them."


The young Marquise looked discouraged, for
she felt there Avas truth at the bottom of this
remark.


\"You are so genuinely charitable, my dear
niece," continued the Marquis; " that I will
confide to you Avhat I have not yet told to the
principal person concerned; I, too, have a
plan of my own for rescuing this unfortunate
girl, as you choose to consider her " (Claire
raised her eyes full of gladness to her uncle's
face); " I will place her in a condition to
retrieve utterly Avhat appears to you as her
sin; I am absolutely independent, and have
the right to do Avhatever I like; my intention
is to rescue this girl in a way none of you
dream of—my intention is to marry her."


\"Oh, uncle, hoAV can you joke upon such a
subject?" cried the young Marquise, with a
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 137 -->
half-terrified, half-reproachful expression, but at
the same time turning very pale.


\"Joke, Claire ! " he echoed; "in that word
you unwittingly expose your whole weakness.
You don't admit even the possibility of such
a project as mine, and you talk of rescuing
people ! " he added, almost scornfully.


\"I clo," rejoined the Marquise, proudly;
\"my desire is to rescue, not to recompense; I
would not reward anyone for the evil done, but.
I would prove that all sin can be atoned for by
repentance."


•' No, my dear niece," interposed the Marquis;
\"you deceive yourself, you are like all those
of your kind: so long as the salvation of the
sinner is to be secured by his punishment, you
go heart and soul into the business, but the
instant the sinner's salvation is to be achieved
pleasantly, you'll none of it; you are all alike,
you devotees."


\"I am not a devotee, uncle," retorted warmly
Claire; "I believe in God Avith my whole soul,
and trust in Him and love Him with my whole
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 138 -->
soul; and I believe in good, and don't believe
that right and Avrong are all one; I believe in
duty, and am convinced that our duty is always
to do more than Ave can do, and never to think
of ourselves : but to reward wrong-doing is
AA'rong, uncle. Sacrifice is the law of our
life."


\"And plenty of it avc get," replied M. de
Moranges, smiling at his niece's animation;
\"we're always making sacrifices, Avhether avc will
or not—always having to forego something Ave
like. It is just that AA'hich makes life such a
mistake—such a blank," he added, in a
someAvhat different tone. " As to me, I'm tired of it,
and mean to try whether domestic comfort is
better Avorth : if you Avere consistent you ought
to approve me."


"Approve you!" retorted Claire; " Avhat!
for giving the most deplorable example ? "


"My dear child," rejoined the Marquis,
gravely; "who gives good examples noAvadays ?
look around you and tell me; your so-called
good examples are mere negations, abstentious
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 139 -->
from absolute evil sometimes, but active,
energetic good—never. No, my dear niece, even
you are not, at this moment, acting up to Avhat
you regard as your principles; you are obeying
the narrowest and most hackneyed of
prejudices." (Claire started.) " Yes; and
obeying it because it is the most hackneyed, and
that you have been born and will die within the
perpetual hearing of it. It is not because you
think I do wrong in marrying a sinful person
(whose sin, mark you, if I took up your side of
the argument, I should say I alone provoked),
it is not for that, my dear child, it is because
that sinful person is not of a condition in Avhich
I ought to choose a AA'ife. Look around you, at
the women everybody receives, and at the
scandals everybody forgets: nay, for that
matter, look close at home, at that woman who
ran away with poor Lancour, your own cousin;
I was told yesterday that Mottefort had actually
taken her back; before a year is out, I shall
hear you all calling her poor Madame de
Mottefort, and celebrating her Christian
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 140 -->
repentance and her husband's Christian mercy, yet I
defy you to think better of her than of the
dreadful woman whom I mean to marry."


\"Uncle," responded Claire, very gently; " I
say again that I clo not knoAV how to argue
with you, but I feel deeply—oh, uncle, indeed,
I feel at the very bottom of my heart, that it is
Avrong to re Avar cl sin."


"Maybe," rejoined the Marquis; "but set
your mind at ease on that point; be quite
certain that Providence will be on the best
possible terms Avith Madame la Marquise de
Moranges, who •will do a world of good in her
parish. She will uot have the entree into your
salons, but cardinals and archbishops, and the
highest dignitaries of the Church, will boAV
doAvn before her, and call her a saint whenever
she chooses, rely upon that."


\"Uncle," said Claire, after a pause of a feAv
seconds, very disconsolately, " I meant to do
good, and I have done none. You and I
cannot discuss, for Ave don't speak the same
language; but still I must always say I feel—nay,
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 141 -->
I know that I am right, though I cannot prove
it to you."


\"My dear child," answered the Marquis,
with an expression almost of tenderness, " you
and I shall be always good friends, for you are
thoroughly sincere and really wish to devote
yourself to others; but you are too young to
know the difference between honesty and
piety, and between morality and prejudice;
you are confused and, in fact, prejudice has
the upper hand; this is as it should be for the
present, only don't be led away by your zeal
for other people's souls into interfering with
their private life; let each man go his own Avay,
whether it lead him to Paradise or elseAvhere,
that's the advice of a man ofthe world."


\"But one's conscience," objected, timidly,
Claire.


\"Has enough to do with one's own conduct,"
retorted her uncle, " without meddling with
one's neighbour. And now, my dear Claire, I
will not, with you, play the hypocrite, for one
instant, but tell you the whole truth at the risk
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 142 -->
of shocking all your opinions. In marrying the
person we have spoken of, I am not thinking
of her rescue, but of my own convenience. I
have upon her guilt and my Avrong very
different notions from yours, and I marry her
because it suits me to clo so."


The young Marquise shook her head in
silence, and looked at her uncle with eyes full
of tears.


"Don't grieve o\Ter me," he added, smiling,
but serious, in spite of himself, " I am merely
a man of the world, Avhose experience of life
has not hitherto been altogether satisfactory.
But whatever comes, I remain your firm friend,
my dear niece. Count upon me at all
hours—only apply to me, mind, for what interests you,
not for what concerns myself; leave my interests
to my own care."  
  
  
  Claire had certainly failed with her uncle.
<!-- Leaf 153 -->
  
  CHAPTER X.  
  
  
  THE PROPOSAL.


And, in reality, what had led M. de
Moranges to this extraordinary determination of
his to marry the Sphinx ? It would be very
difficult to say; men's wilfullest acts
resulting mostly from a combination of various smal 1
causes, and seldom from any one important
motive.


{empty}M. de Moranges was, as the reader scarcely
requires to be told, a thoroughly selfish man,
that term not being meant to imply any
particular degree of wickedness, but simply Avhat
it states, namely, the habit of thinking of self.
{empty}M. de Moranges' whole life had been lived
with a view to himself alone, and exclusive of
the interests, or opinions, or pleasures, or
comforts of other people. He did not take other
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 144 -->
people into account, not because he disliked or
despised them (there never had been anything
misanthropic about him), but because he
overlooked them, otherwise than as instruments
conducive to his comforts, his pleasures, or his
interests. He had led, as has been mentioned,
a very kingly life, having been famed,
submitted to, flattered, and highly considered, for
reasons exclusive of any moral merit, and it
was natural enough that he should conceive
himself privileged to do Avhatever might be
found agreeable without reference to Avhat the
so-called world might say or think upon the
subject.


He had not married in early life for several
reasons; firstly, as has been noted, he had
from his boyish days been so much loved by
so many women that he lacked the opportunity
for choosing one who should be ostensibly the
partner of his existence; secondly, he found
he could have all the advantages of matrimony
without any of its thraldom, and that the world
only craved for admittance inside his doors;
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 145 -->
thirdly, he was by nature despotic, disliking
discussion, and having in common with his
sister the love of dominion; and fourthly, he
was, intellectually speaking, self-sufficing, and
abstractions could fill what he termed his heart
far more than could human beings. He loved
the beautiful in everything, and the grand and
the complete — loved them sincerely —
worshipped excellence everywhere, whether in
politics, art, industry, or what not, and this it was
which chiefly kept him aloof from mere
ordinary affection, and from the problematic pastime
entitled falling in love.


But at fifty-five M. de Moranges felt lonely,
and around him was a void, which the mere
aspect of the beautiful in no matter how many
forms could not fill up. The sterility of his
beauty-worship became clear (though not to
him), for he was possessed only of a shadow,
and created not.


A great warrior, a great statesman, a great
poet may vanquish love, for he espouses
ambition, is a creator, and throws himself forth in  
  
  
  L  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 146 -->
deeds, peopling coming ages with his heirs;
but the mere admirer of other's greatness, the
mere lover of the unpossessed beautiful, comes
at some time or other to see his need, and
wearies over his solitude upon earth.


{empty}M. de Moranges had come to this when he
resolved to take to himself Claude Raynal's
daughter, and bring her up, and fashion her to
his hand. That AA^as a matter of Avhim, and
soon came to an end. Then the Sphinx, having
achieved repute, was transformed into the centre
of a circle, and the surroundings Avhereof she
was the motive, beguiled the hour for a time,
and charmed vanitv. When that Avas
beo-inningto die out, something awoke in the Sphinx
herself, which compelled her master Avithout his or
her knoAvledge.


It was the UnknoAAm before which he
involuntarily bent; it was the Truth that thrilled
through him, though it merely touched him as
he passed by.


What had inspired Claudine ? By what
enchantment had she been suddenly
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 147 -->
transformed ? She had been a statue, she was a
living woman—where was Pygmalion ?


The Marquis's perceptions were much too
fine for him not to recognise the change the
instant it occurred; but the cause ? the cause ?
He sought for it vainly, and then seized upon
a false one. That mattered little, for the work
was clone by the false cause every bit as surely
as it Avould have been by the true one. M. de
Moranges was torn asunder from himself,
forced into occupying himself with another,
and his faith in himself was shaken. He was
fifty-five, the magnificent Marquis, and the
Sphinx, of whose possession he had grown
proud, could love—but loved not him.


She, in whose atmosphere he felt hoav an
indescribable fascination, Avas to him still the
statue : he was not Pygmalion.


Then jealousy tortured him, and he thought
it was too late. But reassured by Olivier, and
persuaded of Claudine's de facto fidelity, the
Marquis clutched at one of those impossible
hopes, which madden by their veryimpossiL 2
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 148 -->
bility. It had been said that the rival he
feared would, in order to win the Sphinx, Aved
her. It was only a word, a suggestion, a
thing he would, had he been in his senses,
have laughed to scorn; but he was not in his
senses, and the seed of suggestion had sunk
into a kindred soil, and had sprouted forth into
a goodly tree.


What if he were to marry her himself? why
not ? Another had been reputed ready to. do
so—why not. he ? and then he thought of the
artist-like pleasure of developing this primitive
nature, and of how she must naturally Avorship
the benefactor he should prove himself to be!
He would noAV watch the melting of the marble
into flesh for him, Pygmalion ? These were
among the ancients' god-like joys, Pygmalion,
indeed ! Avhat did he say ? he was Jupiter, and
she Semele, and he grew lighter and younger as
he thought that happiness was there at his feet,
Avaiting to be picked up if he Avould only stoop.


Well, he would stoop; and having taken
that resolve, he would, according to his nature,
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 149 -->
seek perfection in what he did, and would so
overwhelm this unfortunate, as they styled her,
with his condescension, that she should,
Semelelike, be consumed by the blaze of radiance cast
upon her.


The very day after acquainting his niece
with his new project, the Marquis decided
upon imparting to Claudine the brilliant fate
for which she was reserved, and accordingly
he sought her in the library of the Hotel de
Moranges, the windows of which opened upon
a conservatory filled with strongly-perfumed
plants.


But between our dreams and our acts, and
betAveen our surest hopes and their fulfilment,
there lies so wide a chasm, that M. de Moranges
hesitated to take the handle of the door in his
hand—his heart, yes! actually his heart beat
strongly; and when by dint of will he entered
that room, it was Arery much as any other
humbler lover Avould, who, at fifty-five, might
after all be refused by the low-born she to
whom he offered his hand.
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 150 -->

Refused ? No ! not as the word is used
every day—not that; he kneAV that would not
be; but he wanted more now, and she might
accept him yet refuse herself: there lay the
possible failure, and that he dreaded. But it
Avas but a passing alarm—reasonably speaking,
the Marquis felt sure of the event.


Claudine was seated by the fire, wrapped in
dark purple velvet and sables. She Avas ahvays
chilly, circulation Avith her being slow; she had
been trying to learn hoAV to net purses with
chenille and gold beads, and Avas clumsily
labouring to make her pale fingers obey the
example of Mademoiselle Aspasie's nimbler
ones, when the door opened.


On the entrance of the Marquis both the
Avomen rose, a quantity of chenille and strings
of gold beads fell from Claudine's lap, and the
amiable Aspasie set herself to the task of
picking them up from the carpet, during which.
operation she, unobserved, took a careful view
of her employer's face.  
  
  
  In a few seconds all that had fallen doAvn
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 151 -->
Avas neatly placed upon a table, and
Mademoiselle de Mourjonville, with a modest respectful
air, asked whether, if she were not particularly
wanted, she might petition for an hour's
freedom to answer a rather pressing letter from
home. Claudine looked as though she would
rather she had remained, but the permission
was granted by M. de Moranges with the
blandest promptitude, and, as she retired from
the library, letting an unseen glance linger
over the pair she left behind, she knew as well
upon what errand the Marquis had come as if
he had imparted to her all the details of his
plan.


Claudine was embarrassed, and settled herself
upright upon her chair, as she conceived it was
the practice of fine ladies to do, but she did not
know how to hold her hands, and sought for
the gloves which she thought it would have
been proper to have on. Nothing had ever
been able to cure her of her innate dread of
the Marquis, who, on his side, sat surveying her
with that tender benignity which very
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 152 -->
vainglorious men feel (beyond their betters) for
any individual upon Avhom they are about to
confer some royal bounty.


\"Claudine," said he, with a smile, "do you
remember at one time being so extremely
anxious to be called Madame de Savaray? it
is many months ago, but you seemed
remarkably anxious. Do you remember?"


\"I think I do," she stammered, Avith evident
confusion; " but I assure you, Monsieur le
Marquis, I have never, since then, never "


\"I am not reproaching you," interposed M.
de Moranges, gently; " but I want you to tell
me why you made that request? what was
your particular reason ? "


"I am sure I don't know," replied the
unlucky Sphinx, colouring deeply, and fidgeting
about with her fingers (she would have been so
glad if Aspasie had been there, Aspasie always
knew exactly Avhat to say); " I am so afraid you
would laugh at me, or be very angry if I
were to tell you why," she added in a lower
tone.
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 153 -->

\"I entreat of you to do so," persisted M. de
Moranges, with so much kindness that Claudine
took courage.


\"Well, then," she murmured, " it was
because I thought it would make a lady of
.
lime.


\"And you have a strong desire to be made
a lady of?" rejoined the Marquis, " is that
so, eh?"


"Is it Avrong?" she asked hurriedly, and
looking frightened again.


\"Quite the reverse." And there was silence
for some seconds, M. de Moranges feeling
thoroughly reassured now as to his own
prospects, and gazing at the fire with serene
satisfaction, AA'hilst he dallied with the coils of his
Avatch chain.


\"So that it would really afford you an
unmistakeable pleasure if I were to authorise
you to call yourself Madame la Baronne de
Savaray, and enjoin upon my whole
establishment to know you by that name."  
  
  
  " Oh, Monsieur le Marquis! Monsieur le
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 154 -->
Marquis!" exclaimed Claudine, clasping her
hands in delight, and throwing herself back in
her chair.


She was very beautiful, thus, and in the
sudden glow of pleasure which spread all over
her, flushing her cheek, kindling her eye, and
animating her with Avarm quick life, M. de
Moranges thought he seized ample promise of
the statue's transformation.


"It is a cheap boon to confer upon a
person to whom one is attached," said he,
graciously.


\"For certain, certain," urged the Sphinx,
timidly, " Monsieur le Marquis is not mocking
me?"


"Why should I clo so?" rejoined he. "I
am able to refuse; I am to be trusted when I
giant;" and with those words he rose from
his seat, went to the conservatory, and gathered
a bunch of stephanotis, which he brought back
to the Sphinx, who was now standing staring
at herself in the glass, as though in her childish
joy to make sure that it was her own identical
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 155 -->
self who had just achieved what she for the
moment most longed for.


;t That flower," observed M. de Moranges,
laying the branch of stephanotis on Claudine's
fair hair, " is like the satin of your skin;
not at this moment," he continued, wdth a
smile, " for you are as red as the scarlet
passion-flower there on the wall. I am truly
rejoiced at the pleasure I have been able to
give you."


\"Oh ! indeed, indeed. 1 am the happiest.
woman in the world," cried the Sphinx, Avith
an exultation she could not master.


The Marquis came nearer to her, and took
her hand.


\"Claudine," he said, in an almost serious
tone, " have you not reflected that there is
something beyond being Madame de
Savaray?"  
  
  
  " What? " she asked, wonderingly.


"Those who are Barons of Savaray are
Marquises of Moranges too," he resumed.  
  
  
  " Yes, I know it is the title of your house,"
<!-- Leaf 166, Page: 156 -->
answered the girl, " and that if you did not
choose, I could not bear it, and I am so
grateful;" and she looked at him noAV Avith an
expression of intense delight.


\"But I might choose to give you more than
the name of Savary," remarked M. de Moranges.  
  
  
  " I can imagine nothing more."


\"I might give you that of Moranges," he
added, in a loAver tone, and with an undeniable
and uncontrollable beating of the heart.


"No," retorted she, humbly, "that would
not be right—that is the name you bear
yourself."


\"And that we can bear together," he added,
with a look of princely fondness and
condescension.  
  
  
  " Hoav ? " she asked, Avonderingly.


\"By my making you my Avife, Claudine,"
was the reply. "My mind is made up; I
will marry you, and make you Marquise de
Moranges."


The Sphinx turned deadly pale, and
shrinking from the arms opened to receive her,—
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 157 -->

"Marry me?" she repeated, in a tone of
dismay.


"It is my firm resolve," said M. de
Moranges; "do not be alarmed, my dear
child, or fancy I am trifling with you. I know
my own mind, and have well reflected upon
what I am doing. The world may cavil at my
conduct, but you will in three weeks hence be
Madame de Moranges, and soon get used to
your new position, which naturally overpowers
you at first."


She had slipped from the embrace in which
he meant to fold her, and bending down low,
with her old submissive air, brought her lips to
bear upon his hand, and meekly kissed it.


The Marquis's first impulse towards the
crouching form before him was one of
compassionate superiority; he patted her head as
he Avould have patted a pet spaniel. But it
was evident that his way of divulging his
intentions with regard to the Sphinx must have
been too sudden. He had perfectly crushed
her.
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 158 -->
  
  
She might be annihilated by the honour
done to her; but somehoAv M. de Moranges
did not feel at all that he had played the part
of Pygmalion to his OAvn satisfaction, still less
that of Jupiter.
<!-- Leaf 169 -->
  
  CHAPTER XL  
  
  
  THE DARK SHADOW PASSES AWAY.


The Sphinx's mind, as has been noted all
along, was in a most chaotic condition—full of
odd imaginings, and dark, because no pains
had been taken to enlighten it. It is certain
that the announcement to her by the Marquis
of his intention to marry her had dismayed her
beyond words, and caused her as much grief as
fear.' She so feared M. de Moranges, that the
idea of resistance did not occur to her; but her
dim perceptions pointed to the tremendous
honour conferred upon her by the immutable
decree which separated her from Olivier. In
her ethics, so long as she remained in the place
she now occupied, she might achieve all the
ends of gratitude (and do not forget, gratitude
was her religion) by concealment. She had a
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 160 -->
right, as she thought, to dispose of herself, so
long as it was impossible that he to Avhom she
owed so much could guess at what passed.
She did not look upon this as betraying M. de
Moranges; whereas, to the laAvful Avife—to the
married woman, married before the Maire,
with his scarf on, and the cure at the altar, it
really did seem to her that everything Avas
forbidden. She believed, this ignorant creature,
in the majesty of the institution marriage, as
in the majesty of kings and emperors, and was
in that respect better than her betters. It
was all such a hopeless confusion in the
illtaught girl's brain; ill-taught even more than
un-taught, Slow-Avitted, and inheriting the
lazy, dependent father's indolent subaltern
nature, nothing in the education she had
received had ever shown her the severe,
unmistakeable outlines of what Avas right and
what was wrong. She had heard so much
about the blind submission to all authorities,
that, had she been capable of conceiving the
idea of uprightness on her own account, it
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 161 -->
would have seemed to her almost
presumptuous. And herein lies the one great defect of
all merely clerical education (whether Catholic
or Protestant matters not, so long as it be
exclusively clerical), namely, that it does not
sufficient honour to God's creature, and neglects
to produce in him the recognition and respect
of his own possible integrity.


And so it had been with Claude Raynal's
daughter; like so many in the mass of these
Avretched victims, she knew not the difference
between truth and falsehood, or dishonesty and
honesty, though she was warranted " taught,"
and could repeat her catechism from beginning
to end.


Well then, though nothing stood upright in
this ill-trained mind of Claudine's she had a
superstition about real bond fide married
women; and she regarded marriage in the
upper classes as a kind of temple, into which,
when a woman was admitted, she was forced
to conform to the strictest regulations and
rules.  
  
  
  H  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 162 -->

The idea then of becoming the Marquise de
Moranges, the married wife of her benefactor,
was to the Sphinx an idea full of terror and
misery. But what to do ? She had the
slaveattributes inherent to so many of her species
(not more peculiar to the Eastern than to the
Western female, if you give no better
education to the Christian than to the Mussulman
girl), and she Avould sooner have thought of
throwing herself out of the window, than of
opposing the will of the master to whom, too,
she owed everything.


In her agitation she naturally sought Mile.
Aspasie, and confided to her the trouble she
was in; but that over-enlightened person
immediately undertook to set all her scruples
at rest, and, above all, left upon Claudine the
impression that no one desired her lawful
union with the Marquis so much as she did.
Nay, she went so far in the rose-coloured
projects of all kinds that she invented for the
future, that she actually begged of the Sphinx,
when once she should be enthroned in her high
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 163 -->
estate as Madame la Marquise, to remember
her humble companion, and put her above
want. It was clear to Claudine's
comprehension that Mile, de Mourjonville's interest lay in
this marriage; and she was soon persuaded
by her friend, who knew all about what went
on in the world, that her being transformed
into M. de Beauvoisin's aunt, did just the
reverse of separating her from her husband's
nephew.


She quickly got used in this way to the
notion of becoming a lady, and actually a
married one, though it still seemed strange to
her that there should be so little difference
between the customs of the higher and the
lower classes.


\"It is the money that makes the difference,
and the way of doing things," had assured
Mile. Aspasie; and Claudine grew to believe
her.


Claire meanwhile, who had a genuine horror
of all tittle-tattle, instead of making the
Marquis's matrimonial plans a subject forconfiM 2
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 164 -->
dential gossip with her mother, did this time
think it right to speak seriously to her husband
of Avhat was impending, thereby involuntarily
placing him in the most awkward position
imaginable. In reality he Avas bound hand and
foot, as far as his uncle and the Sphinx were
concerned, and felt that whenever it might
please either of these two to inform him of
the contemplated union, he was condemned to
express his entire approbation in the most
unqualified terms. With Claire, however, he
gave himself the pleasure of treating M. de
Moranges' conduct with unmitigated censure,
only protesting that no remonstrance was
practicable, and that their dignity, as his uncle's
next heirs, imposed silence upon them as a
rigorous duty. Further than this he would not
go, but his animadversion upon the folly and
immorality of his uncle was loud and strong,
and so far satisfactory.


And then, as in every emergency of her life,
the young Marquise had recourse to Madame
Beaudouin, but for the first time the aunt and
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 165 -->
niece seemed to see matters from a different
point of view.


The moment Claire confided to Madame
Beaudouin what M. de Moranges was about to
do, and the injury which, according to her, he
would commit against struggling virtue by
thus rewarding frailty, Aunt Clementine
understood what it was the Marquis had alluded to
in his recent conversation with her, and though
she acknowledged he had told her truly when
he told her she could not defend him, she
showed herself unAvilling to be othenvise than
lenient. She saw mentally before her the
altered face of the Marquis, and guessed at
much which he would have died sooner than
avow to mortal man.


Aunt Clementine's life was really and
definitely settled—she knew what lay before her,
was secure from surprise, and as has been
already said, saw things as from a great
distance, and (unless in the case of such
heartlessness as Berthe's) things mostly appeared to
her too small to be taken into serious notice.
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 166 -->
Claire, on the contrary, in spite of her great
sorrow, was entering on untried years and rife
unwittingly with all the curiosities of life. She
could wonder still, and admire or be dismayed
where her aunt would be merely patiently
contemplative.


\"How poor and insufficient your uncle must
have found life, to have recourse, when its
larger half is over, to such a step! " observed
Madame Beaudouin. " He is sadly to be
pitied ! "


"He is terribly to be blamed ! " retorted the
young Marquise.


\"My OAvn Claire," was her aunt's rejoinder,
with a shake of the head, " to blame one must
know; we know nothing in this case. Suppose
{empty}M. de Moranges loves this poor Avretched girl ?
if he does, he will surely let no one discover
it."


"Loves?" echoed Claire, in amaze. "My
uncle ! my uncle, after the life he has led! it is
impossible."  
  
  
  " The mysteries of the human heart are so
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 167 -->
inscrutable where love is concerned, and lie so
deep," replied her aunt, gently, " that perhaps
each mystery has but its own individual
discoverer. I am inclined almost to believe that
none among us has ever penetrated the mystery
of his neighbour's heart; but we can pity. I
do pity your uncle sincerely."  
  
  
  Claire was surprised beyond measure.


\"I cannot understand you, aunt! " she
exclaimed.


\"It is impossible that you should, darling,"
responded Madame Beaudouin, stroking her
niece's fair hair as it lay back from her pure,
blue-veined temples; "your youth fights against
my experience, as it should do. Youth is
glorious, never just; it may be full of fire and
energy, and devotion, and truth, but it is not
natural that it should be indulgent."


\"But, aunt, you are indeed unjust. I would
have rescued that poor girl—I told my uncle
so—I would have saved, and comforted, and
amended her, and have provided for her. I
pity her, poor creature, from my soul."
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 168 -->

\"Yes, my own Claire, because you
understand her misery and her needs; and you don't
pity him, because you don't understand his.
A man whose pride in his own superiority has
sufficed him all his life, who has lived with
himself alone, despising Avhat men call love,
and who at fifty-five seeks in a marriage with
his mistress an escape—! From what ? That,
Ave know not, but it must be something hard to
bear. And again, I say, suppose he loves her!
Think of that torture, Claire; and to such a
man as your uncle, used from his earliest
years to look down upon those Avho loved, and
Avho allowed their hearts to get the better of
them."


And so they talked on, and Claire, AAdien she
left Madame Beaudouin, did not Understand
any better than when she came why her
uncle's determination to marry the Sphinx
might imply that his entire life had been a
failure.


As she passed through the vestibule to reach
her carriage, she met a footman of her mother's
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 169 -->
coming in all haste to bring her a note. The
man said he had been to the Hotel de
Beauvoisin, and had followed her on here.


The note, in a few hurried words, entreated
the young Marquise to come instantly to her
mother's house.


\"I have such neAvs to give you," said
Madame de Clavreuil; " come quick—such a
joy! such a surprise ! "


In the face of whatever the event might be
that could thus animate her usually calm
mother, Claire simply felt how indifferent all
surprises, however joyful, must leave her. She
said she would come immediately; got into
her carriage, and drove to Madame de
Clavreuil's, unmoved by any expectation or any
hope.


She had hardly crossed the threshold of the
ante-room, however, when her mother rushed
from the neighbouring salon, seized her hand,
and dragging her back through the
drawingroom into her own boudoir, indulged in an
uninterrupted series of expressions of delight.
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 170 -->

\"Oh, Claire, dear, what a happiness !" she
exclaimed. " He will be here in Paris in a few
days; he is perfectly well—quite recovered
from his wounds. It is he whom the
governorgeneral sends with the official report of the
Avhole—there is his letter."


"Whose letter?" asked Claire, staring at
her mother, who snatched an open letter from
a table, and held it out to her.


"Victor's! dear, dear Victor's; whose else
should it be ? " rejoined Madame de Clavreuil.


"Are you mocking me, mother?" asked
Claire, turning white as a marble statue, " or
are you out of your senses? What horrible
fable is this ? What ghastly jesting with the
dead! "


\"But there are no dead, my dearest child,"
repeated her mother, energetically. " If we
read the papers regularly, as, indeed, I fancied
you dicl, though I do not," (Claire had never
looked at a newspaper since the fatal day
which had brought the neAvs of M. de
Lancour's death,) "we should not be so taken
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 171 -->
aback by the news; for it seems that for the
last week it has been known that in that
dreadful engagement where Victor was said to
have been killed, the Kabyles had made
several prisoners, and had, as was supposed,
in their possession two or three French officers
and eighteen or twenty men. Some mountain
fort (I forget its name) was taken quite lately,
and the French prisoners all rescued save one,
a lieutenant of the line, who had died. Victor
was among the number. This was only known
by telegram last night, and this morning your
father got Victor's own letter, briefly stating
how he had escaped."


\"Victor is not dead!" repeated the young
Marquise, in a low tone, and almost
mechanically, as she sat looking vacantly straight
before her—"not dead!" and her pale lips
quivered.


\"I tell you, dear child, there is his letter, his
own handwriting—read it," and Madame de
Clavreuil put the sheet of paper into Claire's
passive hand; "or rather," she pursued, " let
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 172 -->
me read it to you," and she forthwith
proceeded to read Avhat Victor had written to his
uncle. It was a short, pithy account—a
thoroughly military bulletin of Avhat had
occurred. He had been left for dead on the
field of battle, had passed six weeks a prisoner
among the Kabyles, who cured his Avounds,
and took excellent care of him, and when the
fort was stormed, ■ he had helped to make
better terms for the chiefs. He had been sent
by the commander of this last successful
expedition down to Algiers straight, and he was
under orders to start for Paris in a feAv days.
The letter was a mere report, contained as few
Avords as possible, and not one single allusion
to self that Avas not strictly necessary.


While Madame de Clavreuil was reading
her nephew's missive, Claire was staring fixedly
at certain objects which recalled to her mind
painful thoughts of the past. There, in that
very room, it Avas that, two years back, she
had implored her mother to take pity on her;
there, by the fire-place, Avas, even noAV, the low
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 173 -->
arm-chair on which her mother sat when she,
kneeling beside her, besought her to shield her
from a marriage with Olivier. It was all the
same—all! And her mother, too, was
unchanged—still the same pattern of narrow,
negative amiability that flies with unerring
instinct from all greatness—the daughter who
had blamed her father's patriotism, shrunk
from her brother's fame, sacrificed her child to
empty custom, and was marching onwards
through life, persuaded that whether duty were
hard or not she had done hers.  
  
  
  And Victor was alive !


Had Victor been really dead, Claire could
have forgiven all, for was not all one to her
in life ? And whether she eked out her days
as Olivier's Avife or not mattered nothing.
But Victor living, and free, now!—That
rushed across Claire's numbed heart with
a force that made its rebound one of absolute
fierceness.


There was something more hopeless for her
than even Victor's death—and to that she
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 174 -->
had been lightly, foolishly sentenced by her
mother.


Claire rose before Madame de Clavreuil had
finished the last words of the letter, and put
clown her veil, feeling she did not wish the
expression of her face to be seen. Calm she
was not, nor collected, but she had been
striving for the last minute or two to collect
her scattered senses, and she craved to be once
more alone.


\"You can't be going already, Claire ?"
urged her mother.


\"I must go," rejoined the young Marquise,
hoarsely, and in a way that silenced objection;
and, opening the door, she hurriedly left the
room, flying chiefly from the intolerable
oppression of her own misery.


As to Madame de Clavreuil, she despaired
of ever understanding the strange inequalities
of temper she had noticed in her daughter for
the last six months. There, evidently, was in
the atmosphere of the age something which
made young women inexplicable and intolerable.
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 175 -->

When Claire was once more alone and
hidden from view in the corner of her own
carriage, she gave way, and, for the first time,
acknowledged to herself that a burthen had
now been laid upon her which it Avas beyond
her strength to bear. She had borne the news
of Victor's death, but Victor's life and freedom,
and love !—she shuddered before all this, and
felt miserably helpless.


\"Oh, mother, mother!" she cried, stifling
her sobs in the cushions of the carriage;
"how could you doit?—how could you
condemn me to it? "
<!-- Leaf 186 -->
  
  CHAPTER XII.  
  
  
  THE UNEXPECTED RETURN.  
  
  
  Love, thou art bitter, sweet is Death.—Tennyson.


It is the immutable law of our being that
nothing remains absolutely stationary in us,
but is for ever being transformed, moving
onwards toAvards increase or towards decay.
And thus it had been with Claire. To be
loved by Victor had been denied to her, and,
therefore, when she knew herself beloved by
him, the joy of that consciousness soelated her
that her spirit, rising into a heaven of its own,
soared high above all earthly griefs and crosses.


Separation, even, scarcely hurt at the time,
for it was not believed that hearts so purely
joined could separate. Then, as the love
grew, death came, and halloAved it—made it
sacred. But pure and holy though it was, that
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 177 -->
love of Claire's for Victor, its growth had been
giant-strong, no barriers having been set to
the worship for the dead; it had well-nigh
absorbed everything else around it; and Claire,
unsuspicious of evil, had lived so wrapt up in
the memory of her lost love that whatever else
was, in life, was either subservient to this one
sentiment, or took its aspect from it. The
complete sense of what her love for her dead
cousin had groAvn to, only burst upon Claire
when the sudden news came that her cousin
still lived.


Then, indeed, a storm began to rage within
her heart, and, at the outset, she well-nigh
gave herself up to despair. Had she not been
taught to believe devoutly that self-murder
was a crime, she would have seen at once an
issue from her pain; for Claire was of a
dauntless nature, and would have chosen
death resolutely sooner than have descended
one step in her OAvn and M. de Lancour's
esteem. But death was forbidden her. She
must live on through all the dreary days and  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  N
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 178 -->
hours that God had appointed for her; and
she must do her duty, and be true to herself,
and, though parched with thirst, she must go
on living now within view of the divine
draught, which must never touch her lips,
towards which she must never stretch out her
hand. Had she loved Victor less, she might
have more promptly rejoiced in his escape;
but she so thoroughly loved him, that she
confidently waited for the moment when she
should join him for ever—it could not be long
—a few years, more or less; and what were
years to her ? But noAV she must struggle for
honour and duty's sake—struggle against
possible weakness. And what if he should
mistake her!—if he should imagine her love
had decreased!


At that thought she would clasp her hands
with terror, crying aloud for mercy and to be
spared that torture, for she did not know
whether she could bear it.


Poor Claire ! the sacred security of her love
was gone, its brightness was dimmed, its
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 179 -->
integrity impaired. From heavenly, that it had
been, it had become earthly now and troubled.


Everything too combined to unsteady her
mind, and make peace impossible. Even
Olivier, who had it not in his power to do
aught for her happiness, could yet contribute
largely to her disquietude. She was, above all
things, generous and self-devoted, and
disposed naturally to think she had not given
away sufficiently of her own self to other
people. Now Olivier's joy at Victor's escape
had been something so loud and strong and
genuine that his wife was painfully touched by
it, and examining her own heart could not
choose but feel a strange sort of pity for her
husband.


It was the kind of commiseration you feel
for a person sick unto death, and who accepts
the doctor's assurances that he is not going to
die, or for the confiding rapture of a child who
trusts in the promise of some pleasure which
you know is not to be fulfilled. Olivier was,
God knows ! not wronged (nor ever would be;  
  
  
  N 2
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 180 -->
Claire must die before that!)—but he was
deceived, and do what she Avould she could
not help it. Could Olivier look into his wife's
heart, she said to herself that he would not so
rapturously rejoice over the escape from death
of the man whose image, let her struggle as
she might, lay for ever engraved at the bottom
of that heart. This great big foolish felloAV,
heavy-witted, dull-brained, was the most
inoffensive of mortals, kindly-hearted too—and
her husband. There was little or none of his
fault in their ill-assorted union; perhaps if she
had asked him point blank to deliver her from
a marriage with him, he would have helped
her; but she had consented, and this man's
honour had been confided to her keeping.
Claire was too high and too delicately minded
a woman to look upon her entire obligation as
discharged because materially that honour
was safely guarded, and the unbounded trust
implied by Olivier's delight at M. de Lancour's
escape invested him in Claire's eyes with an
indescribable interest. He reminded her of a
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 181 -->
passage in German history which had deeply
impressed her childhood; of that poor,
ignorant lumbering hero, Otto of Wittelsbach, who
set out bearing to the King of Poland a letter
from his friend the Emperor Philip, in which,
counting upon Otto's inability to read, the
Kaiser abused him, and recommended his
brother potentate to throw him into prison!
Olivuer, in Claire's esteem, was exhibiting just
this sort of brute-like trust, and his innocence
and ignorance wounded her to the core.


Olivier, on his side, could talk and think of
nothing but Victor, for whom his admiration
had always been profound. The one only
career he had longed for was the career of
arms, which had been forbidden him; and as
envy was utterly foreign to his nature, he had
sincerely enjoyed Lancour's renown, and
revelled in the military distinction Lancour had
achieved as if he himself had won it.


When Victor was known to have actually
returned to France, to be in Paris, M. de
Beauvoisin knew no peace but in putting
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 182 -->
himself incessantly in pursuit of him. For
several days Victor contrived to elude Olivier's
reiterated invitations to the Hotel de
Beauvoisin; but he could not always do so without
exciting suspicion, so he one day consented to
be one of Olivier's guests at a dinner of thirty
people, given by the latter in his honour.
Claire and her cousin met, but, the first
greetings over, neither spoke to the other, and
no one upon this occasion noted the mutual
avoidance between these two.


During the days that folloAved, the young
Marquise altered the whole tenor of her life.
Instead of the quiet, fireside habits for Avhich,
since her return to Paris, she had been
remarkable, she plunged into every vortex of
fashionable life, leaving no fete of any kind
unfrequented. She was determined that her
cousin should find no opportunity of seeing
her alone in her own home, and, therefore, she
fled that home at all hours; but she yearned
for the sight of Victor, and eagerly sought
the crowds through AAmich he passed, and in
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 183 -->
Avhich she could see him pass at a distance,
too far for the exchange of word or look.


The pure, holy union with him she loved
was dissolved; she was no longer his, nor he
hers; but she might see him—there could be
no harm in that.


\"Put off your mourning, Claire," had said,
boisterously glad, Olivier, and Claire did put
her mourning off; but it seemed to her, while
she did so, as if she were laying aside her
wedding gear. She would let no one touch
her sable garments, but only herself, and Avith
her own hands she put away and locked out of
sight the vestments that, to her, were rather
bridal than funeral ones.


One night, about ten days after M. de
Lancour's return (it was now the middle of March),
Claire went to a ball at the Russian Embassy.
It was late, and the young Marquise left the
ball-room, and went to seek her husband in
the other salons. When she found him, he
begged her to wait a quarter of an hour, as
he had some one to speak to particularly, at
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 184 -->
the end of which time he said he Avould fetch
her, and accompany her home. The young
Marquise tried to persuade her husband,
whenever she could, now, to go with her into
the world, and sometimes succeeded; and he
was never otherwise than flattered by the
admiration she invariably excited.


On the night in question, Claire retired into
one of the smaller salons, and took a seat
upon a low divan, right under an enormous
stand of flowers. These flowers, in reality,
filled up an arcliAvay, through which, in
ordinary times, you passed from a long, wide
gallery, into the contiguous apartments. As it
was, the flowers rose so high that they
completely masked the opening under the arch,
and the persons sitting on the ottomans in
either chamber were, in fact, sitting back to
back, and quite close, without being aAvare of
each other's presence.


Claire rested her head wearily against the
wall, and congratulated herself upon the fact
of no one being in the room to disturb her.
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 185 -->
On the other side, in the gallery, several
persons Avere talking together, but she did not
attend to their conversation.


Suddenly a very feAv Avords Avere uttered
which caused the young Marquise to start, and
to blush all over. The words were
insignificant, but the voice !


\"No, Excellency; I could not accustom
myself to that. What I like in the service is
the perpetual action."


Those were the words. There was nothing
in them; but it was Victor's voice, and Claire
listened.  
  
  
  In gruff tones was replied,—


\"You don't know Avhat you're saying. When
a man has attained at an early age, as you
have done, to superior rank, he may aspire to
anything; but he must not allow himself to be
forgotten—he must keep as much as possible
within the sphere where men's fortunes are
made. Your place, Lancour, is in Paris."


\"May be," was rejoined, in Victor's voice;
\"but you see, Monsieur le Marechal, I aspire
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 186 -->
to nothing save activity. I can take the fact
of being forgotten quite easily, and care not
the least for making my fortune. I love the
service; but, as to staying in Paris, sooner
than remain there one hour beyond what is
indispensable, I would absolutely retire from
the army."


"S !" thundered out the gruff tones
again; " what an incurable original! Why,
you must have taken leave of your senses!
Don't you see that war on a grand scale is
preparing—is inevitable? Not war with a
pack of savages, but real, genuine war—such
as our fathers had to tell of; and who is there,
then, that wouldn't be ambitious ? Death of
my life ! but the Emperors I imagine, doesn't
mean us to go to our graves without having
chastised those upstart Prussians; not to
mention the red-coats, who hate us at the
bottom of their hearts."


\"Bravo, father," interrupted, gaily, a young
voice; " now we're coming to perfidious
Albion!"
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 187 -->

\"Hold your tongue, boy ! " exclaimed the
speaker who had been addressed as
Excellency and M. le Marechal; " I tell you it is
not possible that we should avoid a great war,
and then the foremost posts of command
will be given to the men whom the chief of the
state knows best, and around them will be
grouped all the younger officers of the army,
who have any ambition. Such felloAvs as
Lancour, there, will be generals before they're
forty."


\"In the first place, Excellency," repeated
Victor, " I do not altogether share your
enthusiasm about what you call a great war; and I
belong to the men of my time, who (altogether
unprofessional) esteem peace as superior to
war."


\"Pedants and philosophers," broke in M. le
Marechal, Avith a growl.


\"Yes, philosophers, I grant you; that is,
men who think a man's life a valuable thing,
and utterly repudiate the food-for-cannon
theory; but, besides that, I have not your
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 188 -->
faith in the necessity of a war for France. If
she be but well governed at home, and enjoy
the freedom Avhich is noAV the birthright of
every civilised country, her position in Europe
is secure; she has greatness enough. She
has no one to fear, and can therefore afford to
rest her oavh claims to respect upon a Avorthier
feeling than fear upon the part of her
neighbours."


But, at this, the anger of the high dignitary
burst forth in unmeasured terms, and he
roundly anathematised the whole school of the
young army, who, he said, Avere all
sentimentalists and dreamers, disciples of the
philanthropists of the Revolution, and unworthy of
the honour of being Frenchmen.


\"Bugeaud is ansAverable for a vast deal," he
groAvled, " and his pupil, Trochu, for more
still; with all their prating about intelligence.
But, thank God! the Emperor will one day
set that all to rights, and we shall have the
war that has been clue to us ever since the
morroAv of Waterloo !"
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 189 -->

\"If so, Excellency," replied Victor, " I shall
not be the only French soldier aa-1io will deplore
it for the sake of France's dignity and station
in the Avorld."


"And much the Emperor Avill care for that!
And much that will stand in the way of his
making use of the best men he finds. It is of
little avail your being obstinate, Lancour.
You will, one of these days, be appointed
about the Emperor's own person; and then,
when you see how easy it is to rise, you'll
soon get rid of all your fine humanitarian
notions."


\"It is not in the Emperor's power to force
me to do what I am resohred not to do,
Excellency," answered Victor, gravely. " I
Avill return at the end of this month to Algeria,
or I will retire from the army."


\"Tut, tut, young man; all talk. Don't tell
an old soldier like me such nonsense; you'll
find many a reason for thinking a stay in Paris
pleasant, I warrant you. Everybody has some
chain that binds him to Paris."
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 190 -->

\"I have none," was the reply; " and I
repeat it, I would leave the army sooner than
be condemned to stay here."


Claire had noted every word of the above
conversation, and thought how she was at the
source of all Victor's acts, and how, much as
he loved the stern duties of his career, and
formed as he was, in spite of all he might say,
for all the higher aims of true, ennobling
ambition, how his duty to her overruled every
other thought, and regulated the entire tenor of
his life.


The group on the other side of the archway
had apparently left its position, for the voices
that had spoken were no longer heard, and
the fragments of talk that ensued were carried
on in feminine tones.  
  
  
  "He is terribly altered," said one voice


\"You can see how he has suffered," said
another.


\"Suffered! what nonsense you do talk; as
isa man ever suffered for love."  
  
  
  These words Avere uttered in a tone of
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 191 -->
bitinosarcasm by the Duchesse de Varignan. The
young Marquise recognised her accents.


\"Well, all the same, it is a great sacrifice,"
observed a somewhat pleasanter voice; " you
see the Avound rankles in him. He has, no
doubt, the most glorious career in the army;
everything lies before him, yet he cannot bear
to come back here—he would rather live in
the desert than in the place where he lived
with her."


\"Ah! that struck you, too, did it, Jeanne ? "
inquired what seemed to be a more elderly
person.


\"Struck me ! why, I should think so. Who
could fail to see the truth. Poor fellow! "  
  
  
  "What a pity!"  
  
  
  " What a shame !


\"And for such a woman as Berthe de
Mottefort, too," added Madame de Varignan,
\"so uninteresting, so devoid, to my sense at
least, of all attraction."


\"Yes," rejoined the voice that seemed less
youthful; " but I'll tell you what, my friends,
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 192 -->
no man can get over all of a sudden the
fireside memories left him by a Avoman avIio has
been for three or four years associated with his
everyday life (particularly when she has quitted
him, not he her), he may fancy he don't care,
but he does, all the same; and he won't be
able to bear living in the same place, depend
upon that—it's just one of the Avorst
consequences of these illicit attachments."


Claire heard every word, and though her
whole reason and judgment protested in
Victor's favour, and though her whole soul
repelled the notion of Victor's weakness, and
bore Avitness to his truth toAvards herself, still
an agony of terror seized upon her that she
could not quell. For the moment all command
of herself was gone, and had circumstances
aided, and her cousin Victor been by her side,
she would have been more at his mercy than
she might later choose to remember.


Now, world, clo not judge this agonised
woman. Wild thoughts whirl through her
brain, and she is torn and buffeted by her
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 193 -->
passionate misery. But with her thoughts
you have nothing to do; they are sacred from
your justice so long as they assert themselves
not in deeds. Watch her acts only; they
belong to you, and if she act bravely,
respect her. All have struggled—that is what
the strugglers must remember when they have
vanquished. It is in the memory of the
violence, of the sin, of the crime, overcome, but
conceived, that lies the obligation to be
merciful.


When M. de Beauvoisin came to fetch his
wife, she stared at him for one second as
though she knew him not. Her teeth chattered
with cold, and her hands were burning hot.


\"You have got a fever-fit, Claire," said her
husband, with genuine anxiety. " You have
had a chill; you should have sent for me.

Come, quick."


She drew her lace shawl about her,
shiveringly, rose, took Olivier's arm, and fighting

now against, her suffering resolutely,—  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  o
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 194 -->

\"It will pass away," she said, in a husky
voice. "It is, as you say, a chill."


"Pass away," repeated Olivier; "I hope it
will, indeed; but these chills are frightfully
dangerous. These are just the very attacks
people die of," he added, Avith well-meaning
solicitude, but with his accustomed delicacy of
tact.
<!-- Leaf 205 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIIL  
  
  
  THE CIRCLE NARROWS.


For two or three days Claire felt as if
her thoughts had no resting-place. She was
breathless from misery, and though in her
bitter waking hours and in her sleepless nights
she tried to pray, her prayers were incoherent;
she was too weak to ask with all her heart
for what her heart was breaking, but yet too
strong to petition for Avhat she might not
desire. That she would not do; she held on
desperately to the right, and gasped out
incessant appeals to God to have mercy upon
her. Claire was utterly alone in this trial, and
could lean upon no one, and apply to no one
for support; and she knew it.


Ever since the day of Victor's return the
young Marquise had forborne to utter his  
  
  
  0 2
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 196 -->
name to Madame Beaudouin, and had, indeed,
avoided being alone with her aunt. She felt
that what was tearing her heart in twain hoav
was not to be registered, as it were, noted
down and made unforgetable by confession to
another. Claire was humbled by what
tortured her, and resolved that out of respect for
the name she bore, and for her wedded state,
she would carry alone the burthen placed
upon her.


Oh, how she wept over the dream from
which she had been awakened—over the proud
belief in which she had lived of the holiness of
her love ! It was gone, and for ever; and the
passion with Avhich she had inspired Victor
was of no other nature than that which he had
felt for Berthe, Avho so little deserved his
affection. Was this indeed so? That she could
not knoAV, must never dare wish even to
discover; it was enough that the possible rivalry
with such another had been held up before
her eyes, and in the deadliness of her fear lay
the Avhole Aveight of her punishment.
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 197 -->

Once, in her agony, she thought of telling
the whole to Olivier. But some instinct
warned her that he Avas incapable of
understanding what she would reveal, or why she
revealed it. He would think too little or too
much of what she told him, but he would not
think rightly of it; still, she had no one to
help her, and might she not once in her need
appeal to the husband Avho had been allotted
to her, and cry out to him, " Save me from
myself! "


No ! She would bear it all alone, and, with
God's blessing, overcome it; there were
examples of such victories. There were
women, virtuous and pure, aaIio had loved
and suffered as she had done, and who had
yet stood upright, and borne the shock and
outlived it, and done their duty—why not she ?


Olivier was, after his fashion, very kind to
his Avife all this time, and this too, she bore,
though it had its hardness in more ways than
one. He was full of solicitude for her health
and material comforts, and, above all, anxious,
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 198 -->
as is ever the wont of the good-natured vulgar,
that she should amuse herself; amusement,
the distraction, namely, of the mind from all
its ills, being, according to him, a purchasable
commodity, like a necklace or a horse.


On the fourth day after the ball at the
Russian embassy, the young Marquise went
to the Italian Opera with her mother and her
husband. Olivier left them before the first
act of the Trovatore was ended, and the two
ladies remained alone, unless Avhen visitors
came to the box to pay their court to them.
At the close of the first act Henri Dupont
established himself opposite to Madame de
Clavreuil, and engaged her in a conversation
in which Claire took but an indifferent part;
but, as Henri was seated behind the latter's
chair, he did not see the objects that attracted
her attention.  
  
  
  There was one.


The box occupied by Claire was just in the
bend of the house, so that the inmates of the
next box but tAvo were more visible than those
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 199 -->
of the two neighbouring boxes themselves. A
door opened and shut, and Claire knew who
had come in though the new-comer stood
concealed, and only shook hands with the two
ladies seated in front; but when the hand was
stretched forth, she knew it too, and from that
moment her opera glass was no more laid
clown, and she looked actively in every
direction save in that of the next box but two, where
the new-comer had just entered.


And so the second act passed, and Claire
tried all she could to listen and understand
Avhat was going on upon the stage, but she
could not. An irresistible force compelled her,
and, as the curtain dropped upon the finale
of the second act, her eyes wandered towards
the spot where M. de Lancour stood. He was
leaning against the back of the box, and his
head rose above that of the two ladies in
front, and of a fair haired young girl who was
bending doAvn between them, and apparently
imparting to them some very interesting piece
of news, for they listened eagerly and laughed
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 200 -->
frequently. At the identical moment when
Claire looked at her cousin his glance was not
fixed upon her, but seemingly upon someone or
something in the row of boxes on the second
tier. This reassured her, and she did not avert
her eyes; but before the will to do so had
returned to her, she had met his, and they were
looking at each other.


Only a look! one look in all a life of
renouncement—might it not be forgiA^en? The
more so too, that poor Claire felt that look was
saving her from the misery that was unbearable.
What she could bear was the sacrifice — she
had borne it, Avould bear it unflinchingly to
the end—but what she could not bear was the
doubt. To doubt of Victor was madness, for
in doubt of him lay the incapacity of
answering for herself.


In the look she met fixed upon her there Avas
a revelation of all those things Avhich they alone
could appreciate. It Avas a mournful gaze,
tender in the extreme and charged Avith all
the loving anguish of a farewell that may not
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 201 -->
be spoken. In the painful earnestness that
had stamped itself now upon every feature of
Victor's face there was a warrant of his soul's
nobility, and a mute reproach to her who could
have for one instant mistaken him. Claire's
heart grew calm under that look, and Claire
had once more found a resting-place. Of
Victor's love and truth and Avorthiness she had
no fear now; the man whose eyes rested on
hers then had loved none other as he loved her;
and betAveen him and her there rose no lesser
memory. What if sorrow's shade lay over
them both ? they had not loved to be happier,
but to be nobler—their love was not joy, but
suffering—a passion in very truth and deed—
a truth-and-duty-worship, strong and brave;
and Claire knew that this was so, and was
comforted. That one true, mournful, steadfast,
tender look had called her back to her own
higher self, and made her for ever proof against
the vain words and mean beliefs of ATulgar
minds. Now her whole soul might love him
as before, for, as before, he had relinquished
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 202 -->
her—relinquished her, not because it was easy
so to do, but because his unfathomable love
made all things possible that Avere to be
accomplished for her sake.


And all this in one look ? All this! nay, a
Avhole world more of bliss and wretchedness
and rapturous heart-lore, and passionate
conviction victorious over all the mere dead-weight
of logical lifeless facts. Let those deny it Avho
never once in all their lives have quivered to
the touch of the soul's electricity, and felt the
truth treasonable, flashed into the very depths
of their being.


Claire Avas convinced, and calmed as by a
magnetic power. When she lowered her eyes
she experienced a strange sense of rest. Again
she raised her opera-glass, and looked away,
so that none should mark the tears that stole
slowly, almost unconsciously, down her cheek.  
  
  
  They Avere not tears of bitterness or of pain.


Whilst the carriages Avere being called and
waited for, Claire could not but hear the
fragments of conversation going on in the
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 203 -->
crowd around her. But the words came to
her ears, as it were, materially, without
penetrating into her inner sense. She was absorbed,
and did not even remark how anxious and
uneasy Olivier looked when he came to escort
her out of her box.


"To be sure, it is the very last thing one»
should have thought of," muttered a voice, a
little way behind the young Marquise.


\"You mean the last thing you would have
thought of," replied the sharp tones of the
Duchesse de Varignan; but then, your
experience has been limited in that direction;
it does not astonish me."


\"Perhaps not the thing," argued the voice
that had first spoken, "but the man; it is the
man that astonishes me."


\"Oh, it's M. de Moranges you're wondering
at, is it?" retorted the Duchesse.


\"Well, I don't know; but ask M. de
Sauveterre there what he thinks."


\"I invented her," observed the person
alluded to, who was standing close by.
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 204 -->

\"Well, and are you so confounded by this
marriage as my cousin Jean ?" asked Madame
de Varignan, adding, " You know Jean has not
been a week back from Cochin China, Avhich
may explain, if not excuse, his extreme capacity
of surprise."


\"I'm never surprised at anything," answered
{empty}M. de Sauveterre. " I've lived too long, and
seen too much for that; but I may as well
confess that I did not expect it, for that is really
the truth—I did not expect it."


\"AVhat, you thought the magnificent Marquis
above any nonsense of that sort, did you ?"
rejoined the Duchesse.


\"Oh! I beg to be understood," urged M. de
Sauveterre. " When a thing is either very
Avicked or very silly, one can understand it;
but this is worse than either—it is useless.
That is what I did not expect,"


\"Of course, you do not admit the possibility
of there being any love in the business?"
suggested the young man who had been called
cousin Jean.
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 205 -->

"Any what?" echoed M. de Sauveterre,
with a look, the cynical contemptuousness of
which it would be in vain to attempt to
describe. "Any what? Moranges! One sees,
young man, that you have come from beyond
the seas."


\"Yes, so I thought," replied cousin Jean, in
an apologetic tone; " besides, at M. de
Moranges' time of life "


\"Don't be a goose, Jean," exclaimed Madame
de Varignan. " If anything could help to
support your insane suggestion it would just be his
age; but," she added, lowering her voice to a
whisper, "do you see, we are right in the midst
of the nearest relations—just in the very bosom
of the happy family—and " (pressing forward
as she spoke) "I must go and compliment them
upon it."


At the first mention of the hateful subject
(which had been made loudly enough for every
one round to hear), Madame de Clavreuil had
shuddered, and turned round to see who the
speaker was. At the moment when it suited
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 206 -->
Madame de Varignan to perceive this, Madame
de Clavreuil was looking persistently another
way, and holding Count Dupont's arm in a
manner that seemed involuntarily to solicit
protection. But no one whom it Avas the
Duchesse de Varignan's purpose to plague ever
escaped her.


\"I want to congratulate you," said she, in
her boldest manner, forcing herself through the
intervening bystanders, and kiting a hand on
Madame de Clavreuil's ami. " I Avant to
congratulate you on the approaching event"
(Madame de ClaATeuil shrank from her touch);
"when is it to be?"


\"Elise," ejaculated the unfortunate Countess,
indignantly, " how can you? Such an
infamy is no subject for pleasantry of any
kind."


"Ta, ta, ta, ta," ansAvered Madame de
Varignan, nothing daunted; " don't get on
your high horse. Infamy as much as you
choose, or take any worse Avord you like; but
she is going to be Claire's aunt all the same.
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 207 -->
There you are again at work with your fictions;
but the Bastille was taken in 1792, my dear
friends. You can't send her there; nor get a
lettre de cachet (oh ! if you could, I'd help you
to that; but you can't); you can't put her
down, or put her away, or in any way suppress
her. We live under the discipline of the
blessed code, and mayor and cure will make
the whole thing square; so my advice is, to
look it in the face; no fictions will serve;
you'll have to bear it. You'll be for calling
her Madame I-don't-knoAv-what; but it's all no
use. Look it in the face. Make up your little
minds to it; she's going to be Madame la
Marquise de Moranges, and Claire's aunt; and
now, do please answer my question—when is it
to be?"


Before Madame de Clavreuil could recover,
however, from this attack of malicious
volubility, Henri Dupont prepared to answer in her
place.


\"That it will be as you say, Madame la
Duchesse," observed he, "is, I think, more
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 208 -->
than probable; but when, is a totally different
thing."


"Well," interrupted Madame de Varignan,
\"I shouldn't fancy that M. de Moranges would
be for indefinite delays. Men at his age are
mostly in a hurry."


\"That may be too," replied Henri, in his
cool, quiet way; " but he is not the only party
concerned, and the question you are pleased to
put must depend somewhat upon the other
person, and that person is said to be so very ill,
that "


\"That she actually can't be married ! " cried
the Duchesse, with one of her harsh,
unpleasant laughs. " Well, that is the veriest comedy
I ever heard of! Do you really believe that a
woman of that kind can be prevented by any
earthly obstacle from being made Marquise de
Moranges? I don't."


"I can't say," answered Dupont. "lAvas
assured that she had been for the last week so
seriously ill that the publication of the banns
had been put off."
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 209 -->

\"I'll drive to the mairie of our
arrondissement to-morrow, and see if they are posted up
there," exclaimed the Duchesse.


\"I know a man who did that to-day," added
{empty}M. de Sauveterre, " but there is nothing
announced as yet/'*


\"You see, Madame la Duchesse, your
curiosity Avill have to learn patience," said Henri
Dupont. " Your question as to the when
remains unanswered."


"If you chose," retorted she, sharply, "you
could ansAver it; for I am convinced you know
all about it."


When Claire had heard Henri Dupont
mention the fact of the delay in her uncle's
marriage being caused by the illness of the
Sphinx, she had turned half round, and had
allowed her attention to be seriously engaged
by what he was saying.  
  
  
  She did not turn round sufficiently to force

herself into the disagreeable duty of
acknowledging Madame de Varignan, but sufficiently
to lose sight of what Avent on upon Olivier's
side, whose arm she held.


At that moment the crowd moved on a
few steps; Claire and her husband were
separated from Madame de Clavreuil and
the group who were speaking of M. de
Moranges' extraordinary marriage; and a
man, detaching himself from another group,
came straight up, and laid his hand on
Olivier's shoulder.


\"I've a quarrel Avith you, old fellow," said,
good humouredly, Gaston de Vivienne—for he
it was; " how can you allow that rascally
adventurer to speak to you? "


"Who clo you mean ?" answered M. de
Beauvoisin, with evident embarrassment, " I've
been speaking to nobody "


\"Yes you have," retorted Gaston. " I was
crossing over the lobby just noAv, between the
second and third act, and making right up to
you, when what should I see but that villanous
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 211 -->
fellow Mardonnet actually standing talking to
you."


\"Oh—aye—yes ! I remember," stammered
out Olivier. " He just came up to me for a
moment. After all, you know, he's the deputy
of the department, and one can't refuse to listen
to him if he speaks to one."


"I beg your pardon, mon cher," interposed
Gaston, warmly; " one can, and one must.
He wouldn't speak to me, or to my father, you
may depend upon it. You're too easy, Olivier,
you must shake the fellow off like an insect—
he's nothing but a vile, low intriguer; and he
has got a plan in his head now that you must
help us to thwart. You know the Brunoy
branch of the new railway ? Well, he wants to
be made chairman of the board, and there are
not wanting local influences to support him;
but we must all hold together, and "


{empty}M. de Vivienne's carriage was called, and he
had to leave Olivier in order to offer his arm to
his wife, who at that moment was speaking to
Claire. But as he left him he said,—  
  
  
  p 2
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 212 -->

"Now mind, old boy, you left us in the
lurch about the deputation, but you must stand
by us this time, come what will."


Claire heard these words, and involuntarily
looked at her husband, who stood still staring
at vacancy, and as pale as a ghost.


When M. de Beauvoisin's carriage was
announced, his wife roused him out of the fit of
absorption into which he seemed to have
fallen.


From the door of the theatre to that of the
Hotel de Beauvoisin neither of these tAvo spoke
one word to the other; each was wrapped in
the distracting thoughts of his and her own
life-drama.


And herein lies the ill-aclvisedness of those
Avho judge the tragic element of our modern
age inferior to that of the ancients.
Circumstance alone is different. Our dramas have
more to do with suffering than crime, but a
deep pitifulness lies in the very discrepancy
existing now between real unconquered human
nature and the colourless monotony of the
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 213 -->
aspects of civilisation. Our volcanoes rage
forth from under the surface of flowery lakes,
where no one ever dreamt of them; but they
rage and destroy all the same. The heart is
for ever one; and between our tea-tables and
our stock exchanges there are tragedies
enacted that would furnish matter for a
Shakspeare or a Euripides.
<!-- Leaf 224 -->
  
  CHAPTER XIV.  
  
  
  TOO DEAR.


It was but too true what Gaston de
Vivienne had complained of; and Olivier had
alloAved the man, of whom everybody around
him spoke so contemptuously, and whose
opponent he had declined to be at the election, to
come up and speak familiarly Avith him in a
place of public resort. He had tried, it was
true, to evade him, but since his elevation to
the rank of a member of the legislative body,
Mardonnet seemed someAvhat more difficult to
evade; he had tried to cut short the speech
addressed to him by the deputy, but the
deputy would not let him. He had not shaken
hands with M. Theophile, it is true—(he had
contrived to escape that)—but Monsieur
Theophile was preparing to compensate himself for
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 215 -->
this by making an attempt upon M. de
Beauvoisin's coat-button. He Avould be heard, and
Avhat he Avanted to say was precisely what
Gaston had alluded to :—he wanted to make
sure that Olivier would not join the great landed
proprietors of the department, the gentlemen
of Savre-et-Merle in trying to prevent his
being nominated chairman of the board on the
new branch of the railroad from Brunoy. He
Avanted just that, only that! and Olivier did
not dare to flatly negative his request. He
attempted to make Mardonnet understand that
at that moment he was in a hurry and could
not possibly attend to business, but that, " at
some other time," etc. Yes! but at what
\"other time? " The new deputy wished to be
precise, and pressed for the when, the where,
and the how; for the place, the day, and the
hour; and Olivier, in an agony of
embarrassments, scarcely knew by means of what promise
he had extricated himself from the clutches of
his tormentor; he did not like to think of it.  
  
  
  The next day, at noon, a time when he was
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 216 -->
certain not to meet his uncle, M. de Beauvoisin
sallied forth, and Avalking straight into the
vestibule of the Hotel de Moranges, said he
must see Mademoiselle de Mourjonville for a
feAV minutes upon a very important matter.
The footman avIio took the message came back,
saying it was scarcely possible for Mademoiselle
to receive anyone, she was so busy, but that, if
{empty}M. le Marquis Avould walk into the library, she
would come to him.


He dicl so; and, as he entered at one door,
Aspasie entered by another.


She was, as usual, attired with that sober
unobtrusive taste that made the grace of neatness
her unfailing attribute, and she had as usual
that smile, and that well-studied agreeability
of aspect Avhich made everybody extol the
delightful evenness of her temper. If you had
examined her minutely, hoAvever, you would
have perceived a something (barely perceptible)
about her Avhich Avas not altogether as usual.
Her senses seemed, as it were, all astir; she
was a shade less quiet than Avas her wont; her
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 217 -->
eye glanced about, her ears were apparently
sharpened—she was listening, or searching, or
on the watch in short; but Olivier did not
note all this, and he looked as though it
relieved him to be with her.


\"It is difficult for me now to get away," said
Mile. Aspasie, as she shook hands with her
visitor. " She does not like me to be a quarter
of an hour out of her sight."


\"Is she no better?" asked M. de Beauvoisin,
in a tone that the deeper hold obtained over
him by some other subject rendered almost
indifferent.


\"Sometimes better, sometimes worse,"
replied Mile, de Mourjonville, with an accent of
compassion; " poor thing! she had hardly any
sleep at all last night, so that this morning she
has dropped off once or twice."  
  
  
  " And she is asleep uoav? " rejoined Olivier.  
  
  
  " Just dozing."


"Then you can listen to me," exclaimed the
Marquis, with a fine burst of selfishness, as he
threw himself into a huge arm-chair by the fire.
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 218 -->

Aspasie walked forward a step or two, and
Avith folded arms stood looking at him Avith not
very admiring Avonder.


"I avow," she said, at last, in her most
biting tones, " that whenever I come across
the persons of either sex, who are described as
being under the influence of the tender passion,
they are to me objects of the profoundest
curiosity, and I more and more devoutly thank
my stars that I have remained in ignorance of
what, I believe, continue to be styled by
courtesy the affections! Now look at the example
before us: here are you, Monsieur le Marquis,"
(her voice was infinitely contemptuous as she
addressed him,) " here are you, who to my
knoAvledge have shared (in some degree, I
suppose) the attachment that our amiable friend
upstairs conceived for you, and here is 31. de
Moranges apparently caring enough for her to
trample upon every other consideration in the
world in order to make her his wife, and now
that she is visited by illness—a lingering illness,
which takes her out of thc sphere of your
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 219 -->
pleasures—you neither of you in reality mind
whether she lives or dies. Don't protest against
my words, it is the truth! you are bored by
the whole thing—nothing more."


\"I assure you you are mistaken as to me,"
replied M. de Beauvoisin; " poor Claudine! I
often think of her. Is she much changed?
what do the doctors say it is? but I thought
my uncle was tremendously anxious and
grieved."


Mile, de Mourjonville's expression of
countenance was altered, as she rather hurriedly said,
\"Oh; you know the doctors give different
opinions—we see so many of them; but the
illness seems to be a kind of gastric fever;
some of them say they cannot make it out at
all, and that it is wonderful she is not yet
dead; others again give hopes of her recovery.
Fourchon, the new celebrity whom everybody
raves about, was called in yesterday, and he
gives serious hopes. She is better to-day—
much better; though the night was bad, she
ate, this morning, with a kind of appetite;
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 220 -->
she was not exactly a healthy subject, but
she's strong—very strong," and thus
speaking Mile. Aspasie looked musingly into the
fire.


"Thank God! poor thing," murmured
Olivier, trying to compose an expression of
voice and face suited to the occasion.


\"And you fancied your uncle was beside
himself with grief, did you ? " Avent on Mile, de
Mourjonville in her OAvn strange, peculiar tone.
"You thought that because he committed the
folly of marrying her he would be inconsolable
at her death ? Well; it seems you have a
good deal to learn, yet. I had something, I
confess. Your uncle will marry Claudine when
she gets well, and Avill be a doting husband;
but if she dies he will in a few months grow to
regard it as a very lucky event, mark my
words! and that is what comes of what
ninetenths ofthe Avorld call Love! "


\"But you do not believe that she will die ? "
rejoined M. de Beauvoisin.  
  
  
  " No, I do not," replied Mile, de Mourjonville,
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 221 -->
in the tone in which one comforts a child to
whom one refuses what it Avants; "but that
assurance to your ears means that I am
consequently at liberty to attend to you. Noav,
what is it you want of me ? "


Olivier tried, for decency's sake, to appear
to attach sufficient importance to the condition
of the poor sufferer, Avho, as far as her
knowledge of affection went, had given him all she
possessed, and not to seem in the dying
woman's house to have no memory for aught
save his own concerns; but he Avas, in truth,
wild with anxiety to broach the subject upon
which he came.


\"I have no time to spare, Monsieur le
Marquis," observed Aspasie; " be so good as
to tell me what I can do to serve you. Rest
assured that our charming friend will be quite
well in a week or two."


As she uttered these words, her lip curled
with ineffable disdain, Avhile she cast a look at
Olivier which he dicl not perceive.  
  
  
  " Well, I'll tell you," he began. " I am in
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 222 -->
the most awkward position possible. Last
night at the Italiens "


"You met my brother-in-laAv," suggested
Aspasie.  
  
  
  " You knew ? "


"No, no; quiet yourself, pray. I kneAV that
he wished to speak to you for some clays past
upon business. Bless my soul, there's nothing
so very extraordinary in that; what is there
in speaking to him ? He's the deputy of your
department; he hasn't got the plague."  
  
  
  "Yes, but " M. de Beauvoisin hesitated.
\"But what? " asked Mile, de Mourjonville.


\"It is impossible for me to clo Avhat he
wishes," replied Olivier, in low but firm accents.


\"Ah ! " draAvlecl out Aspasie, leaning back
in her chair, and surveying her visitor from
head to foot; " impossible, is it ? "


"It is so, and you know it is so," retorted
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin. " You know that this time
it is impossible."


\"Then, I think I should tell him so,"
remarked Mile, de Mourjonville, forcing the
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 223 -->
expression of her countenance to be an almost
perfect blank.


\"Not I," murmured Olivier; " but you—I
want you to tell it him."


Mile, de Mourjonville was pleased to look,
as it were, all over her companion, leaving no
corner of him unstudied.


"You wish me to take upon myself an
unpleasant duty for your sake, my good friend?"
at length she said, in a voice that chilled her
hearer; " do I understand you rightly? "


"Well," stammered Olivier; "I wish—I
hope—it's not so very unpleasant."


"If it were not unpleasant, you would not
apply to another person to discharge it; but
never mind that, if it were only unpleasant I
might consent; but it's unprofitable. All I
can say can bring no result. My
brother-inlaw's interests are too deeply concerned. I
cannot help you, Monsieur le Marquis."


There was a dull despair in Olivier's face as
these Avords reached his ear that arrested Mile.
de Mourjonville's attention. It was such
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 224 -->
genuine utter helplessness that it almost
touched her.


"Be so good as to examine the position,"
she said, as though moved by a charitable
desire to explain away her seeming hardness.
"You will recognise the impossibility of any
help being afforded. Mardonnet has got to be
a deputy; true, that is a good deal, more,
perhaps, than he had a right to expect: but
that leads him to want more; he wants money;
he finds the first stepping stone under his feet,
the chairmanship of this railway board, a local
distinction, a natural introduction to what is
termed business—the key to possibilities of
money-making later—he finds this; and you
expect that I can persuade him to give it up.
You are young and innocent in affairs, my
dear Marquis !"


"No, no; that is not what I mean," urged
Olivier, with unwonted energy. "I don't
expect that even you can succeed in making
Mardonnet renounce his present scheme "
Again he paused.
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 225 -->

■"Then what do you expect?" retorted
Aspasie, driving her dagger-pointed looks into
him.


\"I don't expect anything," replied Olivier,
diffidently; " but I hoped that you would help
me to extricate myself from the necessity of
supporting him in his project."  
  
  
  Her look altered somewhat as she listened.


\"You must explain yourself more clearly,"
she observed, in a tone not altogether
discouraging.


\"May I do so ? " he ejaculated with a, for
him, extraordinary degree of animation. " Will
it be any use my explaining myself? will you
help me? will you annihilate the hold he
has ? "


"Hush! hush!" andMlle.de Mourjonville
smiled, as she put her hand upon Olivier's
mouth. " You ask from me a proof of
absolute devotion—not only the abandonment of
my own interests, but the sacrifice of the
interests of my nearest relatives. Suppose
Mardonnet died : it is obviously my interest  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  Q
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 226 -->
that his Avidow should be able to live without
assistance from me "


\"But that is just what I want to propose to
you," interrupted Olivier; " it is in your own
interest that I came."


\"Well, don't over excite yourself, my good
friend," murmured Aspasie; " I have, as you
knoAV, a most friendly feeling tOAvards you, and
we can talk over the matter; but, to prove to
you my impartiality, let me tell you, I think
you immensely exaggerate the importance of
the whole business. What can it matter, in
reality, whether you give Theophile your
support or not ? You may have ideas of your
own; you may be of opinion that a democratic
deputy, a man of the people, is a good thing;
you Avould not be the only one of your caste.
You might "


\"I cannot do it, I cannot clo it," interposed
Olivier, getting gradually out of himself. " I
don't care one straw for republicans, or
royalists, or any opinion under the sun. I
shouldn't mind Soulouque being Emperor, or
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 227 -->
Jules Favre, or any body (so long as he ruled
hard). I never read a paper; but I must go
with my kind; they see and know that I am
forced into doing something I can't bear!
They'll soon begin to ask why? You don't
knoAV what it is to be held in that way! Life's
not worth having. Gaston, too, above all! "


\"Yes, to be sure," muttered Mile, de
Mourjonville, parenthetically; " the Viviennes !
that's awkward ! that comes home ! "


"Gaston! my God! conceive for one
instant, if he guessed! and Henri and Victor!
Think Iioav it hangs over me."


\"Oh, as to guessing," remarked Aspasie,
with a half-comical twist of her mouth;
\"people don't guess at these kind of things;
they either know them or remain for ever
ignorant; there's no guess-work in black and
white; but Avhy need any one of them ever
know ? "


\"Only I know ! " retorted Olivier; " and I
dream of it; and if I had a bad fever, and was
delirious, I should tell it all "  
  
  
  q 2
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 228 -->

Mile, de Mourjonville was Avatching her
visitor as a cat watches a bird. "And,"
suggested she, with a very peculiar look; " if
the trace were destroyed, your knowledge
would cease to be ? you would forget all about
it, and be immaculate in your own esteem—
that's so pleasant! so fitting in a man of your
name and degree ! "


\"Don't torture me ! " cried Olivier; "
remember that your hold only rests on a fraud,
on a theft "


\"Stop there, if you please," replied Mile, de
Mourjonville, looking dangerous; " that ground
is not to be trodden. I have once for all
explained, and you know as Avell as I do that
your own inadvertency alone is to blame; it
was your OAvn fault if you burned what was of
no consequence, and left what Avas; it Avas the
finger of Providence. Camille Avas not to
blame; she was not brought up to practise
the subtle delicacies of honour, such as they
are taught in your illustrious houses" (her
tone was bitterly ironical), " she found the
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 229 -->
trace of what had happened, and kept it—that
is all; and as I say, that trace destroyed, and
your knowledge of any small weakness in the
past goes with it—well, that would cost dear,
besides, how could I answer to Mardonnet,
for ?"


\"Never mind Mardonnet ! ': exclaimed
Olivier, in downright anguish, and seizing
Mile, de Mourjonville's hands in his, " I cannot
go on in this way. I tell you life's not worth
having; I'm afraid of everyone I meet; afraid
to go out or come home. Tell me Avhat I am
to do—I will pay any price for freedom; but
save me, my dear, good Aspasie, you are so
clever—save me from Mardonnet! "


As Olivier uttered the last Avords his voice
shook, and there were tears in his eyes.


There was in the agony of this stupid man,
Avhom no one had ever seen moved, and in the
loquacity of this dull, silent nature, something
that touched Aspasie. She seemed to relent,
and after gazing at. the fire for a few seconds,
biting her lips, knitting her brow, and, in fact,
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 230 -->
calculating hoAV much each contributor was to
furnish—how much the Dowager, how much
{empty}M. de Moranges, and noAV how much his

nephew,—


\"My dear friend," she said, blandly, " you
interest me; I will do my best. You know I
like to oblige; but I am terribly poor—a
dependent myself; and, as I said just now, if
Camille were to be left unprovided for I should
have to support her."


\"But tell me how much," continued Olivier,
eagerly.


\"Well, I should like to spare your purse,
too," answered the considerate Aspasie. "
Suppose we said two hundred thousand francs;
you might have Avhat you wish for in your
hands this very clay—the sum is a moderate
one; yes, for two hundred thousand francs I
will agree to take all further responsibility on
myself, and you Avill be for ever free—free
even to forget that you ever owed me
anything."  
  
  
  But a bucket of cold Avater thrown suddenly
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 231 -->
upon his head could not have acted as a more
potent refrigerator upon Olivier than did the
mention of the sum required. This man,
whose very latent energy had been called forth
in resistance to what he regarded as an
intolerable danger, was ready now to front that
danger rather than pay the price that was
required from him, in order to avert it. The
price took now the form of the intolerable, and
the so dreaded danger receded into the
background, assuming for the moment a bearable
aspect.


\"Two hundred thousand francs ! " echoed
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin, considerably perplexed
between his innate fear of Mile, de Mourjonville
and his indignation at the (as he thought)
outrageous demand on his purse.


\"Two hundred thousand francs," repeated
Aspasie, mildly. " Ten thousand francs a year
at five per cent. It is the price at which I
can afford to enter into the transaction you
propose, because Avhen I have entered into it, I
forfeit all future claim upon my brother-in-law,
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 232 -->
who will naturally think I have betrayed him,
and at the same time I should have to assist
Camille if anything happened to her husband.
HoAvever," she added, rising from her chair,
\"I have no time, as I told you—I must return
to my patient upstairs."


Olivier passed his hand over his forehead,
repeating again,—  
  
  
  " Two hundred thousand francs.


\"You knoAV I have told you all along,"
resumed Aspasie, moving toAvards the door,
\"that I could not understand your making
such a fuss about the matter; you had far
better just do Avhat Theophile asks of you, and
keep your money in your pocket."  
  
  
  " It is too dear," murmured he.


\"That is altogether another question,"
retorted Mile, de Mourjonville, turning round,
with one hand on the handle of the door;
\"each one knoAvs what value he attaches to
what he purchases. Reckoned by what
appeared to be your fears, I should have thought
almost any sum cheap—but that's your affair.
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 233 -->
  
  Au revoir, Monsieur le Marquis, I must go
now."  
  
  
  
As Olivier threw himself into a cab to drive
to the club he muttered to himself again,—  
  
  
  " No ! decidedly, it is too dear."
<!-- Leaf 244 -->
  
  CHAPTER XV.  
  
  
  FREEDOM AVON AND LOST.


For the next two days Olivier said to
himself that the sum named by Aspasie was " too
dear;" but that Avas simply because the
impression made upon him by the price required
was more recent than that left by the evil from
which he Avas labouring to escape. M. de
Beauvoisin was like a great many weak-minded
men; he calculated nothing with precision;
but always over- or under-rated Avhat he Avas
capable of achieving or suffering. When the
Avish to shake off Mardonnet was uppermost, he
honestly thought that he was capable of giving
the Avorld, as people term it, in order to shake
Mardonnet off; but then, Olivier's notion of
the world to be thus given, was (as is often the
case) very circumscribed. When he assured
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 235 -->
Mile. Mourjon that to get rid of an intolerable
annoyance he would pay any price, he had in
his mind, a vague notion of an exceedingly
moderate price. The moment the price was
brought down upon him like a sledge-hammer,
it did what a bloAv of that kind does, it stunned
him, and his very indifferent faculties were
crushed for the moment beyond the poAver of
combining or calculating. He thought he
would give anything to escape from a clanger,
but the " anything " seeming in its turn to be
out of the question; he believed he could bear
the threatened evil; in which he Avas utterly
mistaken, as he soon found.


He received a note from Mardonnet, Avhich
he destroyed and did not ansAver; fancying
that by not answering it he could escape
further importunity; but then he had to settle
accounts Avith the other party, and Gaston de
Vivienne pinioned him doAAm, and made him
pledge his honour that he Avould go all lengths
with his own set in preventing Mardonnet from
attaining his ends in the matter of the railway
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 236 -->
committee in Savre-et-Merle. Then he got
another note from Mardonnet, avIio seemed
prodigiously well-informed of Avhatever he said
or did, and in this document he was certain he
discovered the business-like style of Mile, de
Mourjonville. He began to waver again, and
to discuss with himself, and his perplexities
were terrible. Two hundred thousand francs
Avas a large sum; and, as is mostly the case
Avith men whose education has upon no one
single point developed in them the idea of
absolute truth, it was alternately larger or smaller
to his mind, according as fear or love of money
became uppermost. Might Aspasie perhaps be
brought to take less ? No ! his inmost
conscience said there was no more bargaining Avith
Mile. Mourjon than with Shylock, and that,
had she specified a million of ducats, or a pound
of flesh, she would relentlessly, and to the last
hour, hold to the letter of her bargain.


There Avas to be a meeting of the
Savre-etMerle landowners at the Due de Vivienne's on
the next day but one, and Olivier Avas to attend
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 237 -->
it with Henri Dupont, Avho was to fetch him at
twTelve o'clock. Mardonnet was believed to be
at Malleray, doing his utmost with the local
influences. Olivier breathed more freely.


But the very day preceding that on which
he was to meet his neighbours at the Due de
Vivienne's, Olivier was informed by his Aalet
of a fact which, insignificant as it appeared,
upset all his calculations. The
above-mentioned functionary brought to his master, at
his breakfast, a visiting-card, on which was
printed:—  
  
  
  THEOPHILE MARDONNET,  
  
  
  Deputy of Savre-et-Merle.


\"That gentleman called this morning," said
the man, " but it had not yet struck ten, and I
absolutely refused to disturb M. le Marquis.
However, he said he would call again to-day
at half-past five, and hoped to make quite sure
of seeing M. le Marquis."


\"Impudent rascal! " muttered Olivier,
between his teeth; not so low, nevertheless, but
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 238 -->
that his valet caught the words and fixed an
inquisitive glance upon his master.


\"The gentleman was very importunate,
indeed," continued the domestic; "he came
back, after he had turned to go away, and
said, I must be quite sure to tell M. le Marquis
that if he found no one at home at half-past
five to-day, he Avould be certain to be found
tomorrow, at twelve, atM. le Due de Vivienne's "
(Olivier started, and turned deadly pale),
\"and he likeAvise added, that M. le Marquis
was aware of the business upon which he
came. If I might be permitted to have an
opinion, I should say he Avas a remarkably
vulgar-looking ''


\"But I don't Avant your opinion, Leroux,"
interrupted Olivier, with a haughtiness to Avhich
his own attendants were utterly unaccustomed,
his habit being to spoil his servants thoroughly.
\"You may go."


And the valet departed, needing no further
information to teach him that something had
gone very wrong with his master.
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 239 -->

Olivier had risen late that day, and was
breakfasting alone, which happened sometimes,
though not often, to him. He left his meal
untouched, swallowing only with unsteady
haste a cup of too hot tea. Before noon, he
went out on foot, took the first fiacre he could
find, and drove to his stock-broker's, where he
staid not many minutes, then to his notary's,
where he staid half-an-hour, and then to the
Hotel de Moranges. It was between one and
two when he reached his uncle's house, but
there was no one at home; Mile, de
Mourjonville was really out, and Madame Claudine's
maid, whom M. de Beauvoisin caused to be
summoned, reported, that though exceedingly
weak, her mistress was, on the whole, so much
better, that Mademoiselle had been enabled to
go out shopping, an employment she had been
debarred from for some time owing to the
indefatigable assiduity of her attendance upon
Madame.


Olivier stood for an instant before the
abigail, as though bewildered by the
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 240 -->
disappointment caused him by Mile, de
Mourjonville's absence.


"I must see her," Avas all he Avent on
repeating; and at last: "I see but one Avay," he
said, " I dine here to-day," (the tirewoman
observed that she knew there Avas a great
dinner at the hotel), " tell Mademoiselle that I
will come very early—a good half-hour before
anybody else—if she will be ready. I will not
detain her long, but I have a most important
matter to speak to her about."


\"Perhaps something connected with the
wedding?" suggested archly the lady's-maid,
assuming the privilege of her position.


\"Why—yes—in fact, that is it," responded
disjointedly Olivier; " and it is of the utmost
importance."


How Olivier got through the day he himself
hardly knew, but at each stroke of the timbre,
and at each opening and shutting of the porte
cochere he started nervously, and listened Avith
breathless attention. He Avas so determined
not to be at home at half-past five, that at four
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 241 -->
o'clock he despatched his valet to the club,
telling him to wait for him, as he should dress
there. At six o'clock M. de Beauvoisin was
dressed, though the dinner-hour at his uncle's
Avas half-past seven; but he had ordered his
carriage at half-past six, and meant to make
sure of his private audience of Mile. Aspasie at
seven at the latest.


His carriage was ten minutes late, which
mattered but little, for he could easily be driven
like the wind, and in reality reach the Hotel de
Moranges a quarter before seven, even. But
this very quick driving it was which nearly
ruined his entire combination. In one of the
streets in which improvements have rendered
traffic more than difficult, M. de Beauvoisin's
coupe got blocked by an omnibus; the two
coachmen waged war with word and whip; an
omnibus horse was reputed injured by the
AATheel of the aristocratic vehicle, and then
came the sergent de ville upon the scene,
and all idea of rapid progress Avas cast to the
Avinds.  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  R
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 242 -->

It was not till Olivier had exhausted every
form of protest—Avhether angry, persuasive, or
pecuniary,—that he got free, and could again
reiterate to his coachman the order to " drive
like the wind."


It was a quarter past seven when he sprang
into the vestibule of the Hotel de Moranges.


\"Is any one come yet ? " he asked anxiously,
as he threw his paletot to a footman.


\"No one, Monsieur le Marquis," replied the
servant, " Mademoiselle is in the green
drawing-room, alone."


Olivier — usually slow of movement as of
speech,— actually bounded forwards, and was
in the middle of the " green drawing-room "
before any attendant had had time to open the
door for him.


Mile, de Mourjonville was standing before
the fire, with one foot resting on the fender,
and her hands crossed before her. At the
noise made by Olivier's abrupt ingress, she
turned round. He was by her side, and had
seized one of her hands in his before she
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 243 -->
was quite aware of Avho it was who had
come in.


"I have brought what you asked," said he,
hurriedly, and putting his other hand into the
breast pocket of his coat; "here it is; noAV
give me what you promised."


\"So, Monsieur le Marquis," replied coolly
Mile. Mourjon, " you find it at last not too
dear, do you? "


\"Oh! never mind what I find it! "
rejoined he, showing her a very thick pocket
book.  
  
  
  " Well! let me see


\"Look! " said M. de Beauvoisin, opening
the pocket-book, but not giving it out of his
hand, as with nervously trembling haste he
counted a certain number of bank notes, and
showed a written order to his notary to pay the
rest to the bearer.


Mile. Mourjon followed the operation with
glances, the rapacity whereof was hard to
conceal; but even then she could master
herself, and when she had distinctly seen the  
  
  
  B 2
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 244 -->
sum, she had aspired to, within her immediate
reach,—


\"Some days have passed, M. le Marquis,"
said she, "since I named that price, which
then you called ' too dear'; suppose I were,
now, in my turn, to call it too cheap? "


"Don't, Aspasie!" replied the Marquis—
and it was all he said; but the tone, the
expression of countenance, the Avhole aspect of
the man were such that even Mile. Mourjon
AAras compelled. She no more dared, at that
supreme crisis, trifle with that man, than she
would have ventured to try her tricks upon a
bear at bay.


"Make haste!" added Olivier, " look—it
only wants eight minutes to seven,—for God's
sake bring me AA7hat you promised, or some
one will be coming ! go ! go quick."


And she did go, though not quickly; on the
contrary, she Avent saunteringly to the door,
protesting that she humoured him out of her
great good nature, but when she had closed
the door she fleAV.
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 245 -->

Olivier fastened his eye upon the clock, and
when, at the end of three minutes, Mile, de
Mourjonville re-entered the room, it Avas to
him as though three hours had passed.


"Giving, giving!"* said she, as she held
out one hand to receive the pocket-book,
and showed in the other the envelope of a
letter.  
  
  
  "Here it is," said Olivier; and, as she took

it —


\"Let me count, first," observed she, not yet
tendering to him the paper she held in her
hand.


How he chafed, not allowing himself to
snatch it from her.


"All right!" fell at last from her lips, as
quietly depositing the little morocco case in
her pocket, she offered to M. de Beauvoisin
that for which he had paid so high a price.


His fingers grasped the paper twitchingly,
and with a sort of convulsion his eyes closed.  
  
  
  "You had better see that all is straight on  
  
  
  * A translation of the French, donnant—clonnant.
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 246 -->
your side," suggested Aspasie, with a curious
smile. " It Avould be a pity to make for the
second time the mistake you made once
before."


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin drew a slip of paper from
the envelope he held in his hand, looked at it
for a second or two scrutinizingly, and yet as
with a feeling of repugnance, and then
advancing towards the fire prepared to cast the
slip of paper into it. At that moment a door
opened; quick as lightning Mile. Mourjon
passed be.Aveen him and the fire, covering him
Avith the folds of her silk dress andwhispering,—  
  
  
  " Your uncle! take care ! burn it at home ! "


Olivier had hidden the slip of paper in the
breast pocket of his coat, before his uncle
had had time to perceive anything, and as
guests began to arrive at the same time he
had leisure to recover his self-possession.


But self-possession was perhaps not strictly
Avhat Olivier de Beauvoisin recovered that
night. He drank more than usual, and was
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 247 -->
alternately boisterously gay (as was not his
wont) or abstracted; and during his fits of
abstraction had anyone watched him they
Avould have seen his fingers steal into the
breast-pocket of his coat as though to be
assured of the presence of something very
precious.


After dinner his uncle took occasion to
inform him, while they stood a few minutes
together and alone, that Fourchon had so
immensely benefited Madame Claudine that
her cure was to be considered almost certain
with time and care, and that that being the
case, the banns were to be published in a
couple of days, the advertisement at the mairie
being to be posted up on the morrow.


Olivier expressed delight, at the
announcement. (Everything delighted him!)


When the last guest was departing (it was
between eleven and twelve), " Stay, Olivier,"
whispered his uncle; " I mean you to shake
hands with your future aunt. I wish you to
tell her your satisfaction at what I have just
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 248 -->
told you; it will be graceful as coming from
my nearest relative."


Mile. Mourjon objected—said that it would
disturb the patient, and Avas visibly annoyed
at the notion of the visit. But M. de
Moranges, like all selfish men, was not to be
gainsaid. He said he had seen Madame
Claudine five minutes ago, that she was up
and in very good spirits, and that his nephew's
act of kind attention Avould please her far too
much to do her harm.  
  
  
  " You are too careful, my dear friend," said,

blandly, M. de Moranges, laying his hand
upon Aspasie's arm. " If excess were possible
in such ceaseless, tender care, I should say
yours was absolutely excessive. But I will
ansAver for no harm coming from this little
infraction to your regulations."


Mile. Mourjon yielded, but her vexation,
nay, distress, were evident.


\"Nay, then, I will set you at ease," said M.
de Moranges, gaily. " Watch the clock here,
for exactly ten minutes, and if, at the tenth,
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 249 -->
we are not back in this room, I authorise you
to come and turn us both pitilessly out. Ten
minutes' quiet talk can injure no one."


The uncle and nephew went; and, when
they entered Madame Claudine's room, they
found her seated in a huge arm-chair with
her feet upon the fender, and though with all
the marks of severe recent illness still upon
her face, looking handsomer than usual, and
full of peaceful contentment.


{empty}M. de Beauvoisin kissed the hand of his
future aunt, imparted to her the welcome news
intrusted to him by his uncle, and talked with
a fluency that his hearers were wholly
unaccustomed to on his part.


\"You are a good fellow, Olivier," exclaimed
{empty}M. de Moranges, putting his hand on his
nephew's shoulder; " and I shall not forget
how you have received the announcement of
the event which so nearly touches me : many
another would have run sulky, whereas you,
on the contrary, I never saw you in such
spirits in all your life."
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 250 -->

\"Well, I do feel outrageously happy, uncle,"
rejoined Olivier, looking just what his words
described; " and I'm sure I Avish you and my
aunt every comfort in life."


"Yes, but I dare say, for all that, neither of
you thought of drinking my health at dinner,"
observed Madame Claudine, with gentle
reproachfulness. " Confess that that Avas not.
thought of."  
  
  
  "I grant the omission,"replied M. de Moranges.


"I grant it too," added Olivier; "but I'm
so ashamed of my neglect that I'll drink it.
noAV in anything you choose ! More than
that," said he, laughing, "I'll drink it in the
glass of physic at your elbow; " and he put
out his hand towards a large glass standing on
the table, close to the Sphinx's arm-chair, and
filled with a pale red liquid.  
  
  
  She smiled.


\"Oh, that punishment you might undergo,"
she remarked, cheerfully. " It's only my
pomegranate syrup which Aspasie has just
prepared for me—dear, thoughtful Aspasie! "
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 251 -->

\"Yes, we may well say that," murmured M.
de Moranges.


\"Here goes then for pomegranate syrup,"
cried Olivier, seizing the glass and emptying it
at a draught, "To your health, happiness,
and long life, my dear aunt."


As he replaced it, empty, upon the table,
Mile. Mourjon opened the door.


What her look said it would be impossible to
describe, and she stood for one instant
motionless and as though transfixed. It was, however,
really only the affair of one instant; after Avhich,
she came forward into the room, with much of
her usual air.
<!-- Leaf 262 -->
  
  CHAPTER XVI.  
  
  
  THE NIGHT OF THAT DAY.


Twelve o'clock had not long struck, and
Claire AAyas sitting in her own room, alone,
listlessly letting the hours pass by, not knoAving
Avhy she had not yet gone to bed, but already
wrapt in the vague half-consciousness of a
dream.


The night was one of those Avarm, cloudy,
gusty nights towards the end of March, when
puffs of smoke issue from the most
unexceptionable of chimneys, and the silence is broken
by sudden slaps against doors and AvindoAvs,
and by the fall to the earth of tiles or tree
branches—a thoroughly uncomfortable night.


The apartment occupied by the young
Marquise was on the first-floor, and had no window
to the front. It was situated immediately
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 253 -->
under the nursery of her child, in which we
have once seen Claire established during a
slight illness of little Pierre's. The apartment
consisted of three rooms, a spacious
bedchamber, a tolerably large saloon, and out of
the latter a boudoir. All looked into the
garden. Claire was seated in the boudoir,
but the door into the saloon stood open, and
the soft light shed by one lamp showed dimly
the blue damask hangings of the larger room,
and a beautifully arranged jardiniere filled
with ferns and pink cactus. An inner
staircase communicated with the saloon; and any
one wishing to reach the boudoir must first
come through the latter room.


Claire's seat was by the fire, on a low chair,
right opposite to the door in question, which
she had opened on account of the occasional
whiffs of smoke that the wind forced from the
chimney. How long she had sat there she
scarcely knew, taking, as she did, but small
note of time.  
  
  
  All was very still, except for the sounds that
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 254 -->
were now and then called forth by the Avind's
caprices. It Avas not the continuous Availing
and moaning of the melancholy autumn Avind,
it Avas the unequal puffing and i)anting of
young winds aAvakening beneath the touch of
spring, and disporting themselves fitfully in
their caves. Long lulls were suddenly broken
by whirling blasts, and when they had done
their mischief they subsided.


One heavy flap came against the boudoir
window, accompanied by a wheezing creaking
noise. It aroused Claire's attention. She
rose, opened the AATindoAV, and looked out.
A branch of a very old acacia-tree had
been Avrenched almost entirely off. from the
trunk, and rested helpless against the wall
of the house. The wind was apparently
satisfied with its work, for it had again sunk
down to rest, and all was still and silent.
The night was an unquiet one, and the heavy
masses of cloud tossed about restlessly over
the calm depths of the firmament, now show- *
ing a patient star in the distant heavens, and
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 255 -->
now letting a white ray of the moon struggle
forth.


The night, as I said, was Avarni, and Claire
Avas surprised at the mild breath that came to
her cheek from such a troubled atmosphere.
She closed the window, saddened instead of
refreshed by the contact of the air, and once
more took her place upon the low chair by the
side of the fire. She lent forward, her two
elbows resting on her knees, and her head
supported by her hands, fixing an intently
Aracant gaze upon the fire.


It was not that she was a prey to despair, or
to even active miser}'; she was purposeless in
life, and she did not know how to fight against
that, The torn branch of the acacia seemed
to have fallen upon her heart, and to lie there
with oh, such a heavy load; and in the vexed
rollings of the drifting clouds she saw a kind
of image of her own restless darkened years to
come. But then, the pure light of the eternal
star, far, far away, and patient, patient because
eternal — that was her love. That was the
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 256 -->
resting-place, that the promise and the hope,
and tears of mingled joy and sadness gathered
in Claire's eyes. She traced home to its
source the reason of her being there all alone,
Avatching the fire and listening to the night,
instead of sharing in the various revelries
to which, at that very hour, she had been
bidden.


At dinner at her mother's, some hours
before, it had been stated that M. de Lancour
was leaving for Algeria the next week. Was
not that as she wished it to be ? Dicl not the
very secret of her repose lie in his absence ?
could she be pained by any material
severance ? and AA'hat distance could divide hearts
so eternally one ?


And yet, in spite of herself, her woman's
nature felt that AAdien Victor's presence should
have ceased in the place where she dAvelt,
there Avould fall a chill and a gloom upon that
place. She did not need to see him. No!
honestly, no! neither would he seek her—that
she knew, and the knowledge pleased her.
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 257 -->
  
  And yet—yet what ? she was on the verge

of reasoning, of inquiring, and withdrew
alarmed, throwing herself back into her
dream.


Again a sound struck Claire's ear: it was
not from without this time. It was as though
there were footsteps on the inner stairs
leading to her drawing-room. There was at the
bottom of that staircase a cloth-covered door;
it seemed to her that she heard the muffled
flap of that door, as when suddenly opened
and shut. But at this hour who should open
or shut that door ? who should want to mount
that staircase leading only to her own private
apartment ?


The young Marquise had dismissed her maid
at an early hour, and every one had noAV
retired to rest in the hotel. From her side
of the house nothing was heard of what passed
in the court, and the porte-cochire might SAving
on its hinges, and carriages roll in and out,
and the inmate of the rooms facing the garden
be none the wiser.  
  
  
  VOL. III.  
  
  
  S
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 258 -->

She had been mistaken; it was only the
Avind.


And yet she seemed again to hear footsteps,
and then the turning of the handle of a door.
Claire was brave to excess—naturally brave,—
but her mind Avas not just then attuned to
facts: she was wrapt in her dreamy thoughts,
or she Avould at once have risen and Avalked
towards the noise; but her senses dreamt
also, and what they perceived Avas perceived
dreamily.


This time, however, there Avas reality in the
sounds. The drawing-room door had opened,
there was some one in that room; and, before
this impression had become thoroughly clear
to the watcher, a shadow fell obliquely upon
the wall of the boudoir, and a figure stood in
the doorway leading into the salon. It was
that of a man.


Claire looked up at him—aAved, not
frightened, and did not for the first half second
recognise who it Avas; then she rose, and went,
speechless, up to the unsteady form,
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 259 -->
stretching out both her hands, and gazed in horror
upon the livid face, before her parted lips
could say,—  
  
  
  " Olivier!"


He took her hands in his. His were clammy
and cold as death.


"Lock the doors," said he, very Ioav, but
Avith a strange utterance, " and come back to
me—quick."


Claire did as she was bid, and when she
had locked all the doors on the inside, came
back to the boudoir.


Olivier had sunk down upon a sofa, and lay
with his head resting on a cushion, and with
his eyes closed. His features were draAvn and
pinched, and dark blue and violet lines were
visible round the nose and mouth and under
the eyes. There was adreadful awe round
that head which made Claire sink, she knew
not why, upon her knees and draw close to
her husband.


"What has happened?" she said, in hushed
tones : " why are you so cold ? "  
  
  
  s 2
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 260 -->

He opened his eyes slowly, and with an
evident effort, answered, while his icy fingers
pressed heavily upon her Avrist,—


\"Pay attention to my Avords, Claire, now—
be quite quiet—I have strange things to tell
you—be calm above all," and his fingers closed
upon her arm. " I am poisoned, Claire ! "


She uttered no Avord, neither did she start;
for the words sank down like lead upon her
senses, crushing her into silent rigidity.


\"I have a great deal to say," continued
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin; " more than I shall have
time for; in the first place, mind, that,
tomorrow, when the man comes to examine the
body "


But the numbness of Claire's faculties had
passed away, and making a sudden movement
as though to rise toher feet,—


"What madness it is," she exclaimed, "to
be losing time in this way!—a doctor can be
sent for instantly."


The weight of Olivier's hand held her down
immovably.
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 261 -->

"No one must be sent for," replied he; "but
you must listen to me, Claire, and you must
obey me, for I can waste no words. I know
what has happened, but I shall not have time
to tell you that—I shall be dead in less than an
hour. Don't shrink so; be steadfast, and look
it in the face; I do, Claire: and I assure you
it's not at all what I fancied—my lower limbs
are dead already, but I don't feel any fear—
it's far less difficult to die than people think."


\"Oh Olivier ! my poor Olivier ! " exclaimed
Claire, bending down her head with an
uncontrollable sob upon her husband's knee, for
in the face of death there was about this dull
inferior nature a solemn simplicity, a plain
working-day sort of readiness to go when he
Avas called, that touched her and made her
quiver to the very centre of her being.


Olivier laid his hand tenderly on his wife's head,
and, through the thick masses of her hair, the
chill of those marble fingers reached her brain.


\"The past is past, dear," said he, " but we
must save all we can in the future. I see, as it
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 262 -->
seems to me, clearly, all the terrible mistakes
that it is too late to think of now. I have
nothing to forgive you, my wife, and you have
forgiven me any harm I may ever have done.
I sinned in ignorance, dear, for nothing was
taught me that I should have been taught—■
but I count upon you for help. Don't cry, but
listen. What the Avorld must believe is, that I
have died suddenly—heart complaint, aneurism
—one man only is necessary, one man only
must be secured at no matter what cost. As
soon as all is over call Leroux, and tell him to
go for the doctor who lives over the way—he is
the man who has to report deaths at the mairie
—him you must see the moment he enters the
house, and mind, Claire, whatever be the sum
needed, you must give it to induce that man to
report my death as natural—all the rest is easy."  
  
  
  He gasped for breath, and leaned back.


Claire bowed her head and reverently kissed
the hand that hung heavily over the arm of the
sofa, but the cold swollen fingers seemed not
to feel the caress.
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 263 -->

It cost him a visible struggle to open his
eyes, raise his head, and begin again to speak,
and the glance of the eye was dim, and the
speech was thicker than before.


"I have made no will," said he; "but all
goes to Pierre, and you will administer
everything. Don't let Pierre be brought up as I
was," he added, with a sudden effort of energy;
\"my mother has been my ruin; bring him up
like a man—like all the world—like everybody
—like his fellow creatures; send for Henri and
Victor directly after you have secured the
doctor; but secure him; if needful, trust both,
trust Victor always—he is your cousin; consult
them always; mind about Pierre "


His head fell back, and Claire rose now and
bent over him.


\"Olivier, dear!" she whispered, " if it must
be — if it is indeed inevitable, a priest
should "


\"Raise my head," he murmured, and when
she had done so with her arm,—" Claire," he
continued, more distinctly, and with a look she
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 264 -->
never more forgot, "not even a priest dare
enter here. I believe in God with all my soul,
and hope in his mercy; but that is in spite of
those who taught me. Oh, there too, my wife,
mind our child—take care; teach him to love
God, and to know why he believes. Untie my
cravat, dear," he added, Avith a kind of
earnestness; " and take from my neck a ribbon—
a little blue ribbon; there is a medal, a silver
medal—there, you have it now."


Claire had folloAved the dying man's
instructions, and held in her hand a medal on Avhich
Avas the image of the Virgen del Pilar of
Seville. She knew it but too v.Tell; a Spanish
lady had given it her at Biarritz when she Avas
a child.


\"My God! Olivier," she exclaimed,
trembling from head to foot, and forgetting
everything in her horror at what seemed this
frightful coincidence, " is that woman the ? has
she committed this crime ? "


He stared at her for a moment vacantly, and
then, with a strange smile.
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 265 -->

\"Poor thing," he muttered; "she !—oh no,
poor girl! I understand it all clearly; but
there's no time to tell; she was to have been
the victim—she was," he reiterated, as though
wanting to clutch tightly the sense of his words,
\"only I instead—I drank "


Claire let her head droop upon her husband's
shoulder and hid her face. He seemed to be
uneasily struggling against something that
overpowered him.


\"No inquiry, Claire," he muttered, " none.
My mother must give all her money rather—
all; tell Victor that—and Henri—shut it all
up—hide it—no noise," and then, suddenly, he
made a desperate effort to raise his head, and
to force a look from under his heavy eyelids,
as he said, " And Gaston ! "


Claire could not divine his meaning, for there
was an indescribable expression of terror in his
glazing eye.


\"Gaston," he repeated, " not him—bum—
burn "  
  
  
  Claire vainly sought for the purport of these
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 266 -->
words; but suddenly the aspect of the features
changed, a smile passed over the lips, and in
an almost inaudible whisper,—


\"No matter," he said; " Ave were boys
together—never mind Gaston."


And, as she watched, she felt the weight of
the head that rested on her arm increase, and
she knew that clay had returned to clay, the
spirit having departed.  
  
  
  A corpse Avas there where a living man had

been.

  CHAPTER XVII.  
  
  
  BEFORE AND AFTER.—CONCLUSION.


It is not quite three years since M. de
Beauvoisin died; it was in the spring of 1866, and
the event would have created a stronger
sensation than it did had it not been for the intense
anxiety felt touching the war, which everyone
knew to be impending, and which, in a certain
stratum of society, absorbed men's minds and
prevented them from attending, as they would
otherwise have done, to the occurrences which
happened at their own doors.


It was duly averred that Olivier had died
suddenly from disease of the heart, and with
that, both the world at large and the so-called
intimate friends, rested satisfied.


When Claire found herself in the face of the
dead, she wondered at the strange calm that
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 268 -->
came over her, and at the deep stillness rather
than terror that the Dread Presence ushered
in. She Avas not frightened, she was, as it
Avere, hushed, and God himself seemed too
near to her for that she should pray to Him.
And so she sat, looking at what had, a few
hours before, been a living man, aau.1i senses
upon Avhich so heavy a load was laid that they
could not flutter, but were dulled into quietude.
She tried to recall each Avord her husband had
spoken, and found that his every utterance
Avas so stamped upon her brain, that the Avords
rose up printed before her sight as though
they must always be. She did not knoAV
Avhether she felt grieved or not, but when she
looked at the little silver medal which, with
its blue ribbon had fallen to the ground, and
lay close to the chair AA'hereon rested the
corpse, she felt wondrous pitiful. When the
first streak of daylight came the young
Marquise got up from the seat AA'hence she had
not stirred for nearly five hours, and did
precisely and mechanically Avhat she had been
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 269 -->
told to do by him who could never more speak
to her. She went to Olivier's apartment, rang
the bell that communicated with the room
where his valet slept, and telling Leroux that
his master had had a fit, dispatched him for
the "dead doctor,"* and told him, the instant
that the latter came, to take a carriage and
fetch Count Dupont without delay.


It was half-past six o'clock. The Medecin
des morts arrived, and Claire spoke to him for
five minutes alone. He was apparently
satisfied by what she said to him, for he stated in
his report that the Marquis de Beauvoisin had
died that morning suddenly of an apoplexy of
the heart.


Before he had taken his leave, Henri Dupont
rushed in, full of genuine and profound sorrow
for the death of the man who had leaned upon
him through life.  
  
  
  As soon as Henri was with her, Claire, in


* AVhen any one dies in France, the " medecin des morts "
must be sent for at once, and no burial can take place but
upon his statement.
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 270 -->
obedience to her husband's desire, summoned
her cousin Victor Avho, living only three streets
off, was at the Hotel de Beauvoisin in less than
half an hour.


No one thought it necessary as yet to apprize
the Dowager.


The dead man was disrobed, and robed
anew in the vestments of his eternal sleep by
the two who, perhaps, alone cared aught for
him in life, and, aided by his valet, they laid
him on a couch in the boudoir where he had
breathed his last. Claire gave them such
Avomanly help as was needed, folded the cold
hands over the breast, smoothed the hair upon
the stone-cold brow, moving noiselessly about.
All Avas done in silence, none spake ever a
Avord.


Claire had picked up the ribbon and medal
from the ground, and placed them upon a small
table, on which, when the body was decently
laid out, Henri Dupont proceeded to put by
one by one, the different things that had been
found upon the person of the deceased : his
<!-- Leaf 281, Page: 271 -->
watch, and rings, and keys, &c. He saw the
medal, recognised it, and involuntarily looked
at Claire. She answered his look, and he then
remembered having told her of this same silver
medal.


\"Shall I keep it?" she asked, in a low
whisper; "or will you give it back ? "


\"I will think it over," he replied, in the
same tone and Avith a disturbed air; " for the
moment, keep it."


And he went on putting in order what he or
Victor took from the dead man's clothes.


In the breast-pocket of the coat, M. de
Lancour found a slip of paper, and unfolding it:


\"A bill of exchange; " he observed, coming
close to Henri Dupont, and in the first moment
forgetting all technicalities, "is there anything
that should be paid at once ? " he added.


\"Nay," said Henri, " it is paid, or he would
not have it in his possession."


\"More than that," rejoined Victor, "it is
paid years ago."  
  
  
  " Years ago! Avhat do you mean ? " and
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 272 -->
Dupont glanced eagerly at the long narroAv
slip of paper, one end of which Avas now held
by either man, and over Avhich both bent their
heads with fixed attention.


\"Yes," continued Lancour, " look here :
'April, 1858'—eight years ago next month."


\"Just so," murmured Dupont, turning lividly
pale as one Avho is about to faint, " eight years
iioav —1858—not of age —" and a shudder
passed over his whole frame.


\"It is for a large sum too," resumed Victor;
\"sixty thousand francs ! and two full years
before his majority—he was twenty-one in '60—
but it is paid, Avhat could induce him to
carry it about with him, at this distance of
time."


A groan escaped Dupont's tightly
compressed lips, and he seized the back of a chair
in the strong grip of his right hand, letting his
end of the paper escape. Victor turned it
round in his fingers :


\"Here is Gaston de Vivienne's name at the
back," said he, Avith an altered accent, " yet it
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 273 -->
is not like his hand; the G. and the V. are
like "


But here he, too, stopped suddenly, and a
paleness came over his features, and then he
also let the paper drop, and it lay on the carpet
at their feet, with the name—  
  
  
  Gaston Jean Ferdinand, Marquis de Vivienne,

staring at them from the soiled surface of the
much crumpled paper.


The two men looked at each other, and knew
what their common thought pointed to.


\"How came it not to have been destroyed
in all these years ?" whispered Victor, and
what Dupont answered was pronounced in an
exceeding low tone, but low as it was, the
name of " Gaston " fell upon Claire's ear. She
turned round:


\"He was eager at the very last," she said,
"for something touching Gaston de Vivienne."  
  
  
  " What ? " interrupted, hurriedly, Henri.


\"He could not tell—he had not time," she
replied, "but as he died he seemed to change
his idea, for he told me I must not mind  
  
  
  T  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 274 -->
Gaston, for that they had been boys together,
and that it was no matter."


Count Dupont passed his hand over his face
uttering some indistinct expression of pain.


Meanwhile Victor Avas once more holding
the slip of paper in his hand and examining it
minutely in every detail.


\"It had best be destroyed now," he
murmured; and, at an approving sign from
Dupont, he went up to the fire-place, and,
stooping doAvn, put the bill of exchange into
the fire. Both men watched until the last
trace of the paper had been burnt aAvay.


\"Poor Olivier ! " groaned Henri Dupont, as,
for one second, he leaned both his elbows on
the chimney-piece and covered his face with
his hands.


\"It is eight o'clock," remarked M. de
Lancour, looking at his watch. " You ought, I
think, to send to your mother-in-law." These
words were addressed to the young Marquise.


\"I will go to her, if you will allow me," said
Count Dupont,
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 275 -->

Claire accepted gratefully; and, in a feAv
minutes, both Henri and Victor took their
departure, leaving her to her silent watch over
the dead, shared only with the cure of the
parish, whom she had summoned the instant
the Medecin des moils had left the house.


And now, whilst Henri Dupont. goes to that
hard, wilful mother with the tidings of her only
son's death, we will, as briefly as possible, put
the reader in possession of the facts which had
taken place eight years before.


When OliAuer de Beauvoisin, at nineteen,
committed the folly of purchasing for Camille
Leblond the set of emeralds and pearls for
which she longed, he was aware that the act
was an imprudent one; but he did not regard
it as anything beyond that. He knew he must
one day be exceedingly rich — he had heard
fabulous tales of the way in which men
borrowed large sums, and paid for them when
they succeeded to their fortunes, and he signed
a promise to pay the sixty thousand francs to  
  
  
  T 2
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 276 -->
the jeweller in three months. Before the time
was up, he had, naturally, to confess the Avhole
transaction to Mardonnet, who, for a "
consideration " of a very heavy description,
undertook to obtain the money—and failed ! That
is, that thirty-six hours before the day of
payment, he had to inform his youthful client
that no money-lender he could influence would
agree to advance the requisite sums to a minor
unless the bill were endorsed by some man
who had already attained his majority, and
Avhose means were beyond doubt or dispute.
Olivier's one paramount dread Avas that of
discovery on his mother's part. This was, to
a certain degree, shared in by Monsieur
Theophile; for the character of the Dowager was
so well known, that he thoroughly believed her
capable of repudiating the debt and bringing
an action against all or any parties who could
be convicted of leading a minor into evil
courses.


Discovery was, therefore, to both Olivier
and Mardonnet, a contingency not to be looked
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 277 -->
at in the face. The money must be got—and
the secret must be kept. These were the two
necessities.


In one evening, spent with the young
Marquis, Monsieur Theophile contrived to achieve
his ends; for, by dint of hearing story after
story of what other men had done, Olivier
grew familiar with the fatal project that was
proposed to him, and (re-assured above all by
the fatal notion that secresy could be preserved)
he committed a positively felonious act without
any adequate idea of its enormity. The
discovery Avould have seemed to him intolerable,
but the fact itself was a matter of commercial
transaction involving a simple, straightforward
appreciation of plain right and wrong, of plain,
working-day honesty, such as was adapted to
the ways of life of inferior people, traders, men
of business, &c, and had been neglected in
the education of the Marquis de Beauvoisin.
\"Nobody on earth would ever know one word
of it," declared Mardonnet; and, in two years,
the debt would be paid without any one alive
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 278 -->
having been one bit the Aviser. And so, in
reality, it Avas. Things did fall out just as
Monsieur Theophile had said; but punishment
came all the same, only came much later.


When Olivier came of age, he satisfied all
Mardonnets claims—which were exorbitant—
and he received in exchange all the papers and
documents relating to the money transactions
of his early youth. These said documents he
burnt in Monsieur Theophile's study about six
weeks after Monsieur Theophile had taken unto
himself the lovely Camille as a wife, and had
furnished for himself a home. Olivier never
did recur to this event in thought, but, if he
had done so, he Avould have told you he saw
clearly before his eyes the Avhereabouts of the
scene;. the delivery of the papers and the
burning. And Olivier's conscience was quite
at rest; he had never failed in honour; was
all that a high-born gentleman should be, and
ready to fight, no matter whom, upon the
slightest provocation.  
  
  
  Yet, for all that, Nemesis Avas there; and
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 279 -->
however much M. de Beauvoisin might be
living through life with the conviction that
hidden Avrong Avas poAverless, and that hidden
sin was dumb—or, in other words, that
falsehood was as good as truth—the Avrong was
lying in wait, and the sin would find a tongue.
All was not burnt, and Avhat had happened
Avas this:—


When Olivier handed over to Mardonnet
the sums stipulated by the latter as necessary
to enable him to refund what (in order to cover
{empty}M. de Beauvoisin) he had been himself obliged
to borrow, he received in return certain letters
he had written to M. Theophile upon these
subjects, and four different bills of exchange,
three whereof Avere harmless enough, and upon
one alone of which stood the forged signature.
They were all pretty much alike; Olivier
gathered them all up together in his hand,
counted them, but laid them for an instant
down again upon the table, whence he took a
letter, a coach-maker's bill, and an envelope
addressed to Mardonnet in his own
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 280 -->
handwriting; all these various papers he then
consigned in a bundle to the flames, and took his
leave of M. Theophile, lightened of the sole
burthen he thought he should ever have to
bear in life.


That same evening the lovely Camille, as
was her AA'ont, came in her husband's absence
(Mardonnet mostly passed his evenings at some
minor theatre), prying into his draAvers, and
hunting, ferret-like, among his papers. She
found, covered by a sheet of foolscap, under
Avhich it had slipped, the bill of exchange with
Gaston de Vivienne's name upon it, the
importance of which was well known to her.
This she put into her pocket, and the next
morning at breakfast showed it to her spouse.


Mardonnet, to do him justice, was for
returning it at once to M. de Beauvoisin, " for,"
said he, with a lingering instinct of original
honesty, " I'm paid."


\"Nonsense ! " retorted his wife; " it is
Providence puts it in our hands; it may be of
use some day, and one should never throw
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 281 -->
away a chance of keeping a hold over those
grandees;" and so she kept it for six years,
and only gave it out of her keeping when, on
their return from their Moldo-Wallachian exile,
her husband asked her for it, and she saw that
a sort of ambition being aroused in him, he
would be a safe guardian of the talisman.


The man would have restored the document
to its rightful owner, the woman prevented
him; the man, when once more in possession
of it, would have made, after all, but a clumsy
use of his treasure; but a woman again got it
from him, and transformed it into a deadly
weapon.


The wily Aspasie had not talked over his
plans for half an hour with Theophile
Mardonnet before she was convinced of the
existence of a mystery, and determined that the clue
thereto should be delivered over to her.


And so it was, as Ave know, and the fatal
bill of exchange once possessed by Mile.
Mourjon, the rest was but an affair of time and of
detail.
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 282 -->

Olivier lived for some months in utter
ignorance of Avhat had occurred, and cradled in
the persuasion that of the past there endured
no palpable trace of any kind.


The sight of Mardonnet on the Easter
Sunday when the latter accosted him in the street,
Avas disagreeable to Olivier as recalling
unpleasant memories, but these were vague, and
pointed to no clanger.


He did not like the electoral contest Avith
Monsieur Theophile, because he felt the latter
had it in his power to state ugly things
concerning him; and he, Avho had committed the
act of falsehood, Avas uncertain of the amount
of assurance Avith which, if put to it, he should
give forth the false utterance—the denial of
the true fact. Mardonnet's presence was
uncomfortable to him—nothing more.


But when, in the midst of the electoral
struggle, he received Aspasie's letter (of the
6th July) his drowsy conscience re-awakened
suddenly, and he kneAV that real danger
threatened him. From the shock that he received
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 283 -->
when the fatal bill, bearing Gaston de
Vivienne's signature, was shown to him, Olivier
never entirely recovered. He was from that
hour, degraded in his own eyes. So long as
the trace was lost, the doing of the deed itself
was effaced from the tablets of his mind; the
instant the trace re-appeared, the deed was,
anew—it seemed to him as though he had
clone it but yesterday.  
  
  
  With all the rest the reader is acquainted.


When the death-angel's wing first touched
Olivier's broAv, he kneAV, by some preternatural
revelation by whose hand he died, and felt
that he took Claudine's place in dying. But
what the purpose had been, what was to be
achieved by the Sphinx's death, and by whom
it was combined, or what interest Aspasie had
in her demise ?—these were things beyond his
lights, and the more he thought during the
short time left him on that terrible night the
dimmer his i acuities became, and, at last,
there remained only the consciousness of a
strong, stern necessity for concealment. He
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 284 -->
felt that any research into the dark event must
inevitably stain the honour of the whole family,
that guilt lay on all sides, and that, instead of
being lifted, the veil must be draAAm tighter
than ever over all.


He died like a gentleman, meeting his end
calmly, and, for one brief second before
resigning life, fathoming the depths of error and
misery into which his timid, narrow,
would-bepractical, and Avholly heartless trainers had
betrayed him.


They had feared most for this poor soul the
dangers love brings to youth, and so they had,
to the utmost of their poAver, guarded him
from the Aveakness of loving, and had saved
him as they esteemed, because they had so
fashioned his nature that it should be loveless.
And now, how stood their account summed up
in the face of this corpse ? What were the
dead man's gains, reaped at the cost of a
Avizened heart ? Null. No generous impulse
Avould have led him to give aught of what he
had or Avhat he was to a Avoman nobly loved
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 285 -->
and Avorthy—from all such imprudence as that
he had been secured—but, budding into youth,
he had for one woman forfeited honour, and
another woman cost him, in manhood's prime,
his life—only he loved neither.  
  
  
  Was there any consolation in that ?


When Count Dupont found himself in the
presence of the Dowager he told her, bluntly,
and Avithout any preparation, that her son was
dead. He could not explain to himself why,
but he felt pitiless towards this mother; and
before her startled senses could take in the
horrible news—


"I believe," said he, looking steadfastly at
her, and weighing each word,—" I believe he
did not die naturally; I believe he was
poisoned."


A hoarse guttural cry burst from the
Dowager's lips, and throwing up her clasped
hands over her head—


\"Oh! the monster! " she shrieked out. " I
will tear her limb from limb ! "  
  
  
  " Who? Madame la Marquise?" asked,
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 286 -->
coldly, Henri Dupont,; and even in this hour
of desolation she could conceive the terror of
the situation; and resting her tight-clenched
hands on the top of her head, she stood
glowering wildly at her visitor, whose hard,
steady gaze never detached itself from her
features.  
  
  
  After a pause of a second or two—


\"Remember," whispered Count Dupont,
coming close to the Dowager, and laying his
hand upon her arm,—" Remember that, Avere
the crime proved a hundred times over, and
Avere it only required that a finger should be
raised, or a Avord spoken, to secure the
punishment of the criminal, the finger must not be
raised and the Avord must not be spoken; but
there must be silence for evermore, and the
guilty must go scathless, whoever they may
be. Remember that well; " he added,
pressing her arm in his hand, and speaking with
solemnity. " Wail as you will, for the son
you have lost: mourn over him, and refuse
to be consoled; but seek no solace in revenge
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 287 -->
—for it is forbidden you. You must be
silent."


And so saying he left her, and then she
sorrowed for her child.


The death of his nephew caused M. de
Moranges to postpone his marriage for a feAv
weeks; but at the end of that period the
Sphinx became Marquise de Moranges; and
a very short time after, people ceased to talk
of or to wonder at the event. A fair, pale,
handsome woman, richly dressed, drove about
the Bois, in a well-appointed, emblazoned
landau, and the answer given to those who
enquired her name, was,—


\"Oh ! you know that is the famous Madame
de Moranges : she is not received, but they say
she behaves very properly."


And that was precisely what, at the end of
a year and a half, the Dowager began to
remark. For a whole twelvemonth after her
son's death she shut herself up at Beauvoisin,
seeing none, writing to none, but in her hard
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 288 -->
way mourning for him whose death lay
indirectly at her door. At the end of that time
she crept out of her seclusion, and occupied
herself with life's business as though she could
still find interest in it.


She came again to Paris, conferred with
laAvyers and notaries, bought and sold, and
bargained, and traded for the undeniable good
of her grandchild's property; and was heard
several times to opine that it was neither wise
nor right to exclude so completely the neAv
Marquise de Moranges from all communication
with the family.


\"She conducts herself perfectly," she would
observe. " She is, after all, my brother's
lawful Avife; she will probably have no
children, and little Pierre's interests ought to be
taken into account. He might be sent to see
her," she usually concluded with.


Mile. Mourjon was many months before she
got over the impression of Avhat had happened.
She lost her sleep for more than a year out of
sheer watchfulness over herself; for her chief
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 289 -->
terror was lest she should, in a moment of
weakness, avow the whole, and incur the
penalty due to her crime. However, she
ended by surmounting her nervous depression
of spirits, and is now a rich woman, married
to a building-contractor, who, mainly with her
help, is making a very large fortune. She
lives very retired, but is much esteemed by the
people who frequent her, and thought a very
remarkable woman.


As to Madame de Mottefort, she is welcomed
everywhere; her husband has been appointed
to a command in the neighbourhood of Paris;
and hers is regarded by all genuine devots as
a beautiful case of repentance—a sort of
recommendation, indeed, to go and sin in order
that the sin may be thus retrieved.  
  
  
  And Claire ?


The day following her husband's burial, she
left the Hotel de Beauvoisin, and, for two years
and a half, lived with her little son in her
father's house, neither paying nor receiving
visits—shut up totally from all contact with  
  
  
  VOL. III.
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 290 -->
the world, and living exclusively with her
father and mother, and Aunt Clementine.


One day this autumn I was lounging upon
the asphalte of the Champs Elysdes, when I
overheard some persons before me talking of
the marriage to be solemnized next day
between some man, whom everybody kneAV, and
a widow.


\"It may succeed," said one lady; " she is
such an icicle! But he will never forget the
episode of his youth. That is Avhat these
romances mostly come to; a man runs aAvay
with another man's wife, and has all the love
out before he's thirty, and then comes in
reason, and he makes an end and marries."


\"Well," replied another, " you see the
lovematches don't answer somehow; for I've
ahvays heard her first marriage Avith M. de
Beauvoisin Avas quite an affair of the heart,
and it certainly dicl not turn out successfully."


\"There may be some hope, then, that this
second marriage, being an affair of
convenience, may turn out better," observed a young
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 291 -->
gentleman; " it re-unites all the Clavreuil and
Lancour property. Victor does a good thing
for himself."


"And she is very lovely," said an elderly
man.  
  
  
  The lady who had first spoken smiled.


\"I shouldn't think that mattered much," she
remarked; " however, as you say, it may
succeed."  
  
  
  And thus the world judged.


The next day I went to the church where,
in the quietest and most private manner
possible, the marriage was celebrated. As the
new husband and wife left the sacristy together,
I remarked them well, and thought I saw that
upon the face of each which made me augur
well of their future.


Claire was, as I was told, to leave that night
for Algeria, whither she accompanied her
husband—a sharer in his toils and dangers,
in his joys and success—a true, brave soldier's
wife.
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 292 -->

A bright grave light shone in the eyes of
either, an earnestness of purpose sat upon their
brow, and as they went forth I thought I saw
a promise of happiness that Avould not deceive;
and as they passed me by, I murmured from
my innermost heart:—


\"God speed them! they have been in the
thick of life's battle, and know that that fight
never ends, but must be fought on always unto
death."  
  
  
  THE END.
